      "bodyText": "Brexit is set to be delayed by at least three months, after parliament opted overwhelmingly to request an extension to article 50 on another day of divisive votes that exposed the split in Theresa May\u2019s cabinet. The prime minister is now expected to bring her twice-defeated Brexit deal back to parliament on Tuesday, after she narrowly retained control of the next steps of the process. The votes, the last in a series of vital parliamentary decisions on Brexit over several days, mean that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU should not now take place before 30 June and gave the prime minister a window to resuscitate her plan. But May\u2019s cabinet splintered yet again and eight cabinet ministers, including the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, voted against the government\u2019s motion extending article 50, preferring to keep the threat of no deal in place. In total, more than half of Tory MPs voted against the motion.

The Stoke-on-Trent North MP, Ruth Smeeth, resigned as the parliamentary private secretary to Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, after voting against a referendum. \u201cThis was a really difficult decision to make, but I made a promise to my constituents that I would not consider a people\u2019s vote, and I can\u2019t just pretend this vote is not happening.

All were reportedly asked to resign by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office following the vote and it was announced that they had stepped down on Thursday night. The amendment, tabled by the former Tory Sarah Wollaston, now of the Independent Group (TIG), and signed by around 30 MPs, was voted down by 85 votes to 334. The official People\u2019s Vote campaign had urged MPs not to support the amendment, arguing it was not yet the time to press the case. But TIG\u2019s Anna Soubry criticised Labour for declining to support the amendment, saying: \u201cThis is a betrayal of Labour party members and voters, Labour MPs, Labour\u2019s conference policy and, most importantly, the British public. The Labour party leadership are determined to deliver Brexit, which would harm our country.\u201d Asked whether Conservative MPs who voted against the government\u2019s motion would be disciplined, May\u2019s spokesman said it was clear it was a free vote on Thursday night but that cabinet ministers who voted against the government motion would now be expected to follow government policy. \u201cThe government\u2019s motion won with a substantial majority, one in the name of the prime minister,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt was a free vote and people were free to exercise their votes as they so choose.

The prime minister has consistently emphasised the importance of keeping the threat of a no-deal Brexit on the table, to avoid weakening Britain\u2019s negotiating hand. But a group of her own ministers threatened to resign en masse if she refused to offer them a vote on requesting to extend article 50. The government\u2019s motion said that if May\u2019s plan is approved by next Wednesday, the government will request a brief extension until 30 June, to give parliament time to pass the legislation needed to leave the EU. Government sources indicated another meaningful vote is likely to be held on Tuesday 19 March, with Downing Street working intensively to win over the Democratic Unionist party and the Brexit-backing European Research Group.

The amendment called for steps to \u201cenable the House of Commons to find a way forward that can command majority support\u201d after Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan was rejected for a second time on Tuesday. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cAfter the last few days of government chaos and some defeats, all of us now have the opportunity and the responsibility to work together to find a solution to the crisis facing this country, where the government has so dramatically failed to do so. \u201cWe have begun to hold meetings with members across the house to find a consensus and a compromise that meets the needs of our country.\u201d There is no EU consensus over how to handle a request for an extension.

Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>MPs have voted to ask for a delay to Brexit, meaning the UK would not leave on 29 March, as the prime minister had originally planned.</strong> Theresa May was forced into proposing the motion and allowed her MPs a free vote on it. While she voted for it, a significant number of her own government ministers and her party voted against \u2013 including the Brexit secretary, who had called on MPs to back in moments beforehand. European leaders said the delay would need a strong justification.</li> \n   <li><strong>Theresa May is due to bring her deal back to Parliament for a third time after the Commons rejected the chance to take direct control of the Brexit process.</strong> Today\u2019s Commons vote, which would represent a major constitutional shakeup, was a close-run thing \u2013 with the prime minister retaining authority in that area by only two votes.</li> \n   <li><strong>MPs also overwhelmingly rejected an amendment calling for a second referendum. </strong>Labour ordered its MPs to abstain, believing the timing to be wrong, and only 85 MPs voted for a referendum that would have had remain as an option.</li> \n   <li><strong>Five Labour frontbenchers resigned as shadow ministers over the party\u2019s abstention order.</strong> Ruth Smeeth stepped down before the vote in anticipation of disobeying the leadership\u2019s instructions, while four more frontbenchers who voted against the amendment agreed to resign afterwards.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, said he would stand down after the local elections in May. </strong>Cable said he wanted to make way for a new generation of Liberal Democrats, though he said he would stay on if a general election or a second referendum was called in the intervening period.</li> \n   <li><strong>The party suspended Lord David Steel over his admission that he was aware Cyril Smith was a child sexual abuser, but failed to assess whether he was a risk to children. </strong>The former Liberal leader made the comments in testimony to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and the Lib Dems have launched a formal inquiry.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues <strong>Heather Stewart</strong>, <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong> and <strong>Peter Walker,</strong> have the full story:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/14/mps-vote-by-majority-of-210-to-extend-article-50-and-delay-brexit\">MPs back Brexit delay as votes lay bare cabinet divisions</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c8ade05e4b0eff8e0fc344a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-14T23:08:51.029Z\">11.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The decision to suspend Steel was taken by the party in Scotland, <strong>Vince Cable</strong> has told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme, adding that they acted \u201cquickly, properly and in an orderly way\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There was very serious concern about what he said, serious allegations, they have got to be investigated. I think the proper procedure which has been followed is that he is suspended while these investigations take place.

The investigation needs to precede, we will look at the consequences when they happen.</p> \n   <p>Naturally, if there is distress in the family, we are deeply concerned about it. We need to investigate what happened and establish the truth.</p> \n   <p>There\u2019s a disciplinary process, we need to establish what happens. He is innocent until proven guilty but he is suspended and the action will follow up on that.</p> \n   <p>We have acted very, very quickly.

My colleague Jennifer Rankin has some answers:</p> \n  <h2>How does it work?</h2> \n  <p>Extending Brexit is a job for EU leaders, say numerous diplomatic sources. The EU\u2019s 27 heads of state and government would have to decide unanimously at an EU summit on Thursday 21 March. But first the UK has to ask. The EU cannot consider the question until the British government makes a formal request to extend article 50.</p> \n  <h2>Would the EU say yes?</h2> \n  <p>Probably. While any single country has the right to block a Brexit extension, most diplomats think the EU would agree, although this cannot be taken for granted.</p> \n  <p>The wildcard is that EU leaders have never discussed the issue and often take a stricter line than officials.

She did not say \u201cwhether\u201d or \u201cif\u201d she wants to use the mandate. The SNP wanted that message heard: it tweeted out that interview to its 220,000 followers. But there\u2019s a significant timing problem here, which senior figures in her party are well aware of.</p> \n  <p>She can only exercise that existing mandate before May 2021 \u2013 the date of the next Holyrood elections. (The SNP say their primary mandate derives from the Scottish parliament.) And time for that is rapidly running out: the optimum time for a referendum would allow a year to elapse before another election. To hold one by May 2020 means she would need to win Westminster\u2019s approval (highly unlikely to be granted), pass referendum legislation and allow six months for the campaign, in little more than a year.</p> \n  <p>Yet on Thursday she said she actually wanted to see article 50 extended and then a second EU referendum, telling first minister\u2019s questions: \u201cLet\u2019s get no deal properly off the table; let\u2019s seek a lengthy extension to allow this issue to go back to the people.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That appeals to a large number of independence-sceptic moderate and centre-left Scottish voters: many more back EU membership than independence. But resolving these questions could take months; her spokesman acknowledged that after first minister\u2019s questions. So their stance on when she would update Holyrood on her independence plans is subtly changing. She was due to do so by 29 March. It will now come \u201cin due course\u201d and \u201cin the near future\u201d, her spokesman said.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon is facing a rapidly looming challenge: independence or Europe. She must either disappoint her restless troops or the larger number of voters who want Scotland, and the UK, to remain in the EU (something she wants too). Her senior colleagues know this. And there is a final conundrum: if she succeeds in helping to kill Brexit entirely over the next few months, through attrition or a second EU referendum, then her only rationale for staging a second independence referendum now would die too. Why? Because then that \u201cmaterial change\u201d in Scotland\u2019s circumstances, her mandate, disappears.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-14T15:20:53.650Z\">at 3.20pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c8a6775e4b0cf92e5a5706d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-14T14:42:47.707Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Best for Britain,</strong> the anti-Brexit campaign that favours a second referendum, has put out a statement saying that it does not want MPs to vote for that today.

In May there will be elections to a new European parliament and if we choose to pursue a referendum Britain will have to take part. The last referendum was ugly and divisive with claims on both sides that were untrue. The debate has since worsened. Cries of traitor, which used to echo around far-right rallies, are routinely heard in Westminster. To re-elect MEPs to a parliament we promised to leave months earlier, while also seeking a referendum in terms that are not considered legitimate by many, is like walking into a room full of explosives with a lit match.

This might encourage more opposition MPs to vote for the agreement. Tory whips suspect there are about 70 Labour MPs who don\u2019t want a second referendum, and who might be joined by another 30 prepared to vote for May\u2019s deal if they thought it might break the impasse. This is, essentially, what Ted Heath did in 1971.

And the prime minister has always been abundantly clear about this. The choices are, no deal, no Brexit or the deal. You can\u2019t just say \u2018we don\u2019t want no deal\u2019 without saying whether you are going to achieve that by having a deal or by having no Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On cabinet members defying the three-line whip, he blamed \u201cconfusion\u201d.

Some of us felt that we had to follow the logic of having already voting against amendment A, and carry that through and vote against it again. Others felt they couldn\u2019t do that because they wanted to clearly show their support for the view that no deal is not a good outcome.</p> \n   <p>It was a very difficult and confused situation because people had been offered a free vote on the government\u2019s motion and once the government\u2019s motion became amended there was some confusion about what the position was.</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t expect there to be mass sackings as a result of last night. </p> \n   <p>I told the House of Commons that I would support the government\u2019s motion, but I voted against amendment A because it is a unicorn, because it proposes something without delivering a means. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hammond says \u201cconfused\u201d situation led to ministers ignoring three-line whip last night.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Asked about his calls suggesting a cross party approach for a softer Brexit, Hammond said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s what some of my colleagues who voted against the prime minister\u2019s deal need to think very carefully about.

There\u2019s much more to it, you can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/14/brexit-how-would-an-extension-to-article-50-work\">read the full thing here,</a> but here are some highlights:</p> \n  <h2>How would an extension work?</h2> \n  <p>Extending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> is a job for EU leaders, say numerous diplomatic sources. The EU\u2019s 27 heads of state and government would have to decide unanimously at an EU summit on Thursday 21 March. But first the UK has to ask. The EU cannot consider the question until the British government makes a formal request to extend article 50.</p> \n  <h2>Would the EU say yes?</h2> \n  <p>Probably. While any single country has the right to block a Brexit extension, most diplomats think the EU would agree, although this cannot be taken for granted.</p> \n  <p>The wildcard is that EU leaders have never discussed the issue and often take a stricter line than officials. In December, for example, EU leaders decided it would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/eu-rejects-irish-backstop-time-limit-but-backs-technological-solution\">pointless granting the UK further legal assurances</a> on the Irish backstop, concluding that another legal paper was unlikely to sway MPs in favour of a Brexit treaty. It turned out they were right. But blocking an extension could be seen as tantamount to forcing the UK to leave the EU without a deal. The EU does not want to go down in history with the blame for Brexit.</p> \n  <p>And the British request matters: the UK must be able to show \u201ca <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/12/credible-justification-needed-to-delay-brexit-says-donald-tusk\">credible justification for a possible extension</a> and its duration\u201d, a spokesman for the European council president, Donald Tusk, has said.</p> \n  <h2>What is a \u2018credible justification\u2019?</h2> \n  <p>That\u2019s not entirely clear. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has said he opposes \u201cany extension of article 50, even just for 24 hours, if it is not based on a clear majority from the House of Commons in favour of something\u201d. Some EU sources say \u201ccredible justification\u201d means time to hold a general election or a referendum. Others have no fixed view, and member states don\u2019t want to be boxed in with strict criteria.</p> \n  <h2>How long?</h2> \n  <p>A short \u201ctechnical\u201d extension of two to three months to allow parliament to pass Brexit legislation would have been easy to agree if MPs had voted for the Brexit withdrawal agreement.</p> \n  <p>Now the deal has gone down in flames, the EU faces a dilemma. A short extension is seen as heightening the chances of the UK tumbling out of the EU just before European elections. But a long extension means the EU could be bogged down in Brexit for months or years, while numerous foreign and economic policy problems are jostling for attention.</p> \n  <p>Various options have been mooted, from three to 21 months, but there is no fixed view.<br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/14/brexit-how-would-an-extension-to-article-50-work\">Brexit: how would an extension to article 50 work?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c89f2f7e4b016d23425b841\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-14T06:29:37.160Z\">6.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some very touching responses have come in overnight from MPs (and members of the public) wishing well to Andrew Gwynne, Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, who tweeted that he would not be able to attend last night\u2019s vote because his seven-week-old grandson was being transferred to ICU.</p> \n  <p>Other MPs, including Jess Phillips, Stella Creasy, Hilary Benn, Liz Kendall, Anna Turley, Albert Owen, Lisa Nandy, Caroline Flint, and many more, tweeted their support for Gwynne, wishing his family well and saying they understood and supported his decision to be with his family rather than to be at parliament.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GwynneMP/status/1105853056623788033\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Before it all hits the fan on social media I want to explain that I won\u2019t be in Parliament tonight to vote.

This is <strong>Kate Lyons </strong>kicking things off as politicians return to the Commons for yet another day of voting on yet more Brexit motions.</p> \n  <p>Last night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/approve-my-deal-or-face-article-50-extension-may-warns-brexiters\">we saw dramatic scenes in the House</a>. <strong>Theresa May issued her MPs with an ultimatum; back her deal, or face a long delay to Brexit. </strong>But her authority within her party is vanishing. Last night\u2019s events were a total and humiliating shambles for the Conservative parliamentary party and the prime minister, as May was openly defied by ministers who abstained rather than follow the party whip. The result of last night\u2019s votes, however, means the <strong>threat of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March has almost certainly been removed</strong>.</p> \n  <p>As many commentators have pointed out, this is virtually unprecedented; normally, open defiance from cabinet ministers like we saw last night, would lead to them being strongly disciplined, and repeated losses in significant votes would see the PM step down.</p> \n  <p>Today, the vote is about extending Article 50. Parliament will vote on a motion that<strong> sets next Wednesday as the deadline for MPs to pass a Brexit deal.</strong> It says, if a deal is passed by then, the government will seek an extension of article 50 until 30 June. But if the deal is not passed by then, then the government will need a longer extension, requiring the UK to take part in European elections.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s been a huge and exhausting week of Brexit news. Stay turned as we endeavour to keep you updated, and make sense of this craziness. Once again, I\u2019ll be kicking things off and would love to hear from you - contact me in the comments, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsKateLyons\">Twitter</a>, or via email kate.lyons@theguardian.com - and I\u2019ll be holding the fort until my colleagues <strong>Matthew Weaver </strong>and <strong>Andrew Sparrow</strong> take over later on.</p> \n  <p>All set?

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re closing this live blog down now. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: MPs have voted to ask for a delay to Brexit, meaning the UK would not leave on 29 March, as the prime minister had originally planned. Theresa May was forced into proposing the motion and allowed her MPs a free vote on it. While she voted for it, a significant number of her own government ministers and her party voted against \u2013 including the Brexit secretary, who had called on MPs to back in moments beforehand. European leaders said the delay would need a strong justification. Theresa May is due to bring her deal back to Parliament for a third time after the Commons rejected the chance to take direct control of the Brexit process. Today\u2019s Commons vote, which would represent a major constitutional shakeup, was a close-run thing \u2013 with the prime minister retaining authority in that area by only two votes. MPs also overwhelmingly rejected an amendment calling for a second referendum. Labour ordered its MPs to abstain, believing the timing to be wrong, and only 85 MPs voted for a referendum that would have had remain as an option. Five Labour frontbenchers resigned as shadow ministers over the party\u2019s abstention order. Ruth Smeeth stepped down before the vote in anticipation of disobeying the leadership\u2019s instructions, while four more frontbenchers who voted against the amendment agreed to resign afterwards. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, said he would stand down after the local elections in May. Cable said he wanted to make way for a new generation of Liberal Democrats, though he said he would stay on if a general election or a second referendum was called in the intervening period. The party suspended Lord David Steel over his admission that he was aware Cyril Smith was a child sexual abuser, but failed to assess whether he was a risk to children. The former Liberal leader made the comments in testimony to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and the Lib Dems have launched a formal inquiry. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart, Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker, have the full story: The decision to suspend Steel was taken by the party in Scotland, Vince Cable has told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme, adding that they acted \u201cquickly, properly and in an orderly way\u201d. There was very serious concern about what he said, serious allegations, they have got to be investigated. I think the proper procedure which has been followed is that he is suspended while these investigations take place. We take it very seriously. Asked by ITV News whether it was time for him to apologise to victims, Cable said: No it isn\u2019t. The investigation needs to precede, we will look at the consequences when they happen. Naturally, if there is distress in the family, we are deeply concerned about it. We need to investigate what happened and establish the truth. There\u2019s a disciplinary process, we need to establish what happens. He is innocent until proven guilty but he is suspended and the action will follow up on that. We have acted very, very quickly. It is a voluntary party, these are not people who are professionally employed in disciplinary investigations, we convened the group immediately the day after this allegation was made. I think it has been dealt with very expeditiously and promptly. The Press Association has produced this helpful timeline of the last three days in Parliament \u2013 for those of us who are feeling somewhat lost. Tuesday MPs vote overwhelmingly to reject the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal for a second time, by 391 to 242. Wednesday The Commons votes in favour of an amendment to a government motion which rejected the idea of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal under any circumstances, by 312 votes to 308, although the vote is not legally binding. An amendment from the Malthouse compromise group of Conservatives that called for a \u201cstandstill\u201d agreement lasting as late as the end of 2021, under which the UK would observe EU rules and pay into Brussels budgets, is heavily rejected by 374 votes to 164. Another amendment seeking to delay Brexit until 22 May is defeated by a majority of 210 MPs. MPs then support the amended government motion rejecting a no-deal Brexit by 321 votes to 278. Thursday MPs reject an amendment seeking to extend Article 50 in order to hold a second Brexit referendum by 334 votes to 85. Another amendment tabled by the Labour MP, Hillary Benn, which sought to allow the House of Commons to hold indicative votes on what kind of Brexit deal should be negotiated, is narrowly defeated by MPs, by 314 votes to 312. A Labour amendment calling for a delay to Brexit to \u201cprovide parliamentary time for this House to find a majority for a different approach\u201d is rejected by 318 votes to 302. A government motion seeking to extend the Brexit process is then passed by 413 votes to 202. The former Liberal leader, Lord David Steel, has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats following his evidence to the Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse about Cyril Smith. Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on 13th March 2019, the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed. The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation. That work will now commence. It is important that everyone in the party, and in wider society, understands the importance of vigilance and safeguarding to protect people from abuse, and that everyone has confidence in the seriousness with which we take it. We appreciate the difficult work that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is doing on behalf of the victims and survivors of abuse, and the country as a whole. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, believes the UK could extricate itself from the backstop under the terms of the Vienna convention if it began to have a \u201csocially destabilising effect on Northern Ireland\u201d, according to the Daily Telegraph (\u00a3). The paper is characterising the new legal advice it says has been issued by Cox as an attempt to win over those Brexiters who have so far been unable to support the prime minister\u2019s deal \u2013 such as the ERG and the DUP. But it does not rate his chances of success, saying senior Brexiters have already dismissed the advice as \u201cerroneous\u201d and \u201cbadly misconceived\u201d. And tensions within the Tory party are boiling over, with the prime minister\u2019s former policy chief \u2013 who resigned in 2017 \u2013 tweeting: Lewell-Buck was the shadow minister for children and families, Madders was a shadow health minister and Fovargue was a shadow education minister. Three more Labour shadow ministers have resigned from the party\u2019s frontbench \u2013 taking today\u2019s total to five \u2013 over their decision to ignore the leadership\u2019s instruction to abstain from the vote on whether or not to call a second referendum. It had been reported that Justin Madders, Emma Lewell-Buck and Yvonne Fovargue were among four shadow ministers asked to resign by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office. All of them voted against the second referendum amendment today. A statement just released by the Labour leader reads: I would like to thank Yvonne, Emma, Ruth, Justin and Stephanie for their service while on the Labour frontbench. I understand the difficulties MPs have felt representing the views of their constituents during this process. All of us across the House now have the opportunity to work together to find a solution to the crisis the government has plunged us into. Labour\u2019s alternative plan can unite people, however they voted in 2016. I look forward to continuing to work with them to secure a Labour government, end austerity and give real hope to the whole country. The first to go today was Ruth Smeeth, who resigned prior to the vote so she could defy Corbyn\u2019s order. Stephanie Peacock, the other of the four asked to resign afterwards, announced she had agreed to do so about a hour ago. The Irish premier, Leo Varadkar, has said London needs to tell the EU about what purpose an extension would serve and how long it would last. Varadkar said he welcomed Westminster\u2019s vote to extend Article 50 as it reduces the likelihood of a cliff edge, no-deal Brexit at the end of the month. There seems to be two emerging options \u2013 ratification of the withdrawal agreement followed by a short extension into the summer, or a much longer extension that would give the UK time and space to decide what they want to do, including considering options that had been taken off the table like participation in the customs union and single market. I think we need to be open to any request they make, listen attentively and be generous in our response. This matter will be now discussed further at next week\u2019s European Council meeting and hopefully we will have more clarity from London in the meantime about their intentions. Unanimity by the 27 will be required for any extension. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, cast doubt on the EU Commission\u2019s desire to allow an extension. Cable has now released a statement on his impending departure: I indicated last year that, once the Brexit story had moved on and we had fought this year\u2019s crucial local elections in 9,000 seats across England, it would be time for me to make way for a new generation. I set considerable store by having an orderly, business-like, succession unlike the power struggles in the other parties. So I wanted you, our members, to know that, assuming Parliament does not collapse into an early general election, I will ask the party to begin a leadership contest in May. It has been my great privilege to lead the Liberal Democrats at this crucial time. I inherited the leadership after two difficult and disappointing general elections. But I take pride in seeing the party recovering strongly, with last year\u2019s local election results the best in 15 years, record membership and a central role in the People\u2019s Vote campaign. Cable\u2019s departure in May as leader will trigger a 12-week contest. He has said: I wanted to set it out so that there\u2019s an orderly process of succession and the next generation can come through rather than chaotic power struggles you\u2019re seeing inside the Tory party and Labour party so I wanted us to do better than that. In his interview with the Mail, he added: I would obviously like to have presided over a spectacular recovery [of the Lib Dems], rather than a gradual recovery, but events were beyond my control. The fact that the issue of no Brexit and peoples vote is still live, that Theresa May can\u2019t get her Brexit deal through, that we\u2019ve managed to scrub no deal is a tribute to the kind of campaigning that our party\u2019s done. I think it is a creditable performance, and I\u2019m very happy to let someone else take it on. However, he he would stay on as leader if a general election or a second referendum was called. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable, will stand down the role after the local elections in May, he has said. In an interview with the Daily Mail, Cable said he wanted to pave the way for a new generation to lead the party through Brexit, but declined to back a successor. He has told the paper: My wife Rachel has been very supportive [of my time as leader] and doesn\u2019t mind me doing it and has come round the country with me, but she would like to spend more time with me. I think she will see it as a bonus that she sees me more. I\u2019ll be continuing as an MP. I want to get back to writing books again in my spare time. Stephanie Peacock, who ignored a Labour instruction to abstain and voted against the amendment calling for a second referendum, has resigned from the party\u2019s frontbench. Peacock was in the opposition whip\u2019s office \u2013 a junior shadow ministerial position. And there could be more, if this unconfirmed report is accurate: The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, has attacked Labour after the party failed to support the vote on another referendum. Labour have predictably let down the cause of a people\u2019s vote this evening. This was their first chance to stand up and be counted, but instead they sat on their hands. Brexit remains in chaos with the government having faced heavy defeats this week. The Commons has agreed by a large majority that article 50 will have to be extended. With the hallowed exit date of 29 March more or less scrapped, it now seems inevitable that Brexit will be delayed or very possibly stopped. A people\u2019s vote remains the only way to resolve what is fast becoming a national crisis. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who voted for the delay, has nevertheless told Channel 4 News it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d to have a long extension if the EU insisted on a Brexit delay of around two years. I think people want to get on with this. There are now two options on the table: One is to deliver the prime minister\u2019s deal, which just can be delivered by 29 March or a short technical extension afterwards. Or, the alternative to that is a long extension, which I don\u2019t want to see. The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, voted against the delay. But she said that, since parliament had agreed to request an extension, it must be a \u201cswift one, with purpose\u201d. She added: We must deliver the result of the referendum, and hurry up about it. The decision of the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, to also vote against the delay is getting some attention: Business leaders have welcomed the vote on an extension to article 50 but urged MPs not to drop the ball because of extra time. Edwin Morgan, the interim director of the Institute of Directors, said \u201cfew in business will be stepping forward to thank parliament for its efforts this week\u201d, while the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said trade was still in the \u201cdanger zone\u201d . While there is widespread relief that a cliff-edge Brexit was now likely to be averted, businesses are desperate for an end to the continuing uncertainty. Adam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s director general, added: While most businesses will support an extension to article 50 to avert the prospect of a messy and disorderly exit on 29 March, with just two weeks to go this vote leaves firms with no real clarity on the future. The Food and Drink Federation has warned of catastrophic consequences of a no deal Brexit. Its chief executive, Ian Wright, said: As the focus moves away from a 29 March 2019 exit date towards a later date, we must not overlook that 29 March is still the date in the Withdrawal Act. It is critical that MPs now follow-through on their intentions with actions. The government must swiftly agree the length of delay with the EU and table a statutory instrument to change that date. Only then can the diversion of time, effort and money towards no-deal planning be halted. And Morgan added: We know a tiny, tiny amount more about the next steps than we did a couple of days ago, but the problem is that the clock is still ticking and no deal is still the default. It may be folly to hope that parliament can agree on anything more than what it doesn\u2019t want, but the Brexit process parted company with reason a long time ago, so what choice do business leaders have? Here\u2019s some political reaction to the evening\u2019s action in the Commons: The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, told Channel 4 News: We are talking to the government and to the attorney general at the moment to try and make a deal happen because we want to see Brexit working, we want to see it working for the whole of the UK in a way that doesn\u2019t leave Northern Ireland behind. A brief note on the prime minister\u2019s motion on delaying Brexit: The tellers announced it was passed by 412 votes to 202 but the division list records it as 413 to 202. We\u2019re amending the blog to reflect that. We\u2019re getting the division list now and it appears that many in the government voted against the government\u2019s preferred option \u2013 to delay Brexit. It was, as noted, a free vote; so there would be no expectation any of the above might be compelled to resign. Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has confirmed that she voted against the government motion. That does not count as a rebellion, because it was a free vote, but one can assume that Theresa May did not find it helpful. According to Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, also voted against an article 50 extension. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. This is from Adam Price, leader of Plaid Cymru. This is from Nick Boles, one of the Conservative MPs most heavily involved in backbench attempts to get MPs to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The European commission has issued a response to tonight\u2019s vote. It is stressing that the UK would not automatically be granted an extension to article 50, and it says the EU would have to consider its own interests when deciding whether to agree one. After the final result was announced, Jeremy Corbyn rose on a point of order in the Commons to urge Theresa May to work for a consensus on Brexit. He said: After the last few days of government chaos and some defeats, all of us now have the opportunity and the responsibility to work together to find a solution to the crisis facing this country, where the government has so dramatically failed to do so. We have begun to hold meetings with members across the house to find a consensus and a compromise that meets the needs of our country. But the last few days have also put a responsibility on the prime minister. First, to publicly accept that both her deal and no deal are simply no longer viable options. Secondly, to bring forward the necessary legislation to amend the exit date of 29 March. Tonight I reiterate our conviction that a deal can be agreed based on our alternative plan that can command support across the house. And I also reiterate our support for a public vote not as political point-scoring but as a realistic option to break the deadlock. There was no reply from Theresa May, or any other government minister. Here are the Tory and Labour MPs who rebelled on the Hilary Benn amendment. Some 15 Tories defied the whip to vote in favour of it. They were: Guto Bebb (Aberconwy), Richard Benyon (Newbury), Nick Boles (Grantham and Stamford), Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe), Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon), George Freeman (Mid Norfolk), Justine Greening (Putney), Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield), Sam Gyimah (East Surrey), Phillip Lee (Bracknell), Oliver Letwin (West Dorset), Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury), Nicholas Soames (Mid Sussex), John Stevenson (Carlisle), Edward Vaizey (Wantage). And six Labour MPs defied the whip to vote against it. They were: Kevin Barron (Rother Valley), Ronnie Campbell (Blyth Valley), Caroline Flint (Don Valley), Kate Hoey (Vauxhall), John Mann (Bassetlaw), Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton). In what does not rank among the biggest surprises of this week\u2019s round of Brexit voting, Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister who is now the chief organiser of the European Research Group (ERG), says he voted against extending article 50: The big question now is whether the EU will agree to a UK request for an extension. My colleague Jennifer Rankin has some answers: How does it work? Extending Brexit is a job for EU leaders, say numerous diplomatic sources. The EU\u2019s 27 heads of state and government would have to decide unanimously at an EU summit on Thursday 21 March. But first the UK has to ask. The EU cannot consider the question until the British government makes a formal request to extend article 50. Would the EU say yes? Probably. While any single country has the right to block a Brexit extension, most diplomats think the EU would agree, although this cannot be taken for granted. The wildcard is that EU leaders have never discussed the issue and often take a stricter line than officials. In December, for example, EU leaders decided it would be pointless granting the UK further legal assurances on the Irish backstop, concluding that another legal paper was unlikely to sway MPs in favour of a Brexit treaty. It turned out they were right. But blocking an extension could be seen as tantamount to forcing the UK to leave the EU without a deal. The EU does not want to go down in history with the blame for Brexit. And the British request matters: the UK must be able to show \u201ca credible justification for a possible extension and its duration\u201d, a spokesman for the European council president, Donald Tusk, has said. The Commons has now adjourned, after some criticism of Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, for his comments yesterday that money spent on non-recent child abuse investigations has been \u201cspaffed up a wall\u201d. Have we had more ministerial rebellion this evening? Sky News\u2019 Kate McCann says Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, was possibly among those who voted against the government on extending article 50: The motion passed means Theresa May will now ask the EU for an extension to article 50 until 30 June 2019 if her deal gets approved by next Wednesday. If they agree \u2013 as most assume they will \u2013 the UK will not be leaving the European Union on 29 March. If May\u2019s deal is not passed by next Wednesday, then the motion warns that a long extension of article 50 is likely to be required, which would require the UK to take part in the European elections. It\u2019s 413* in favour, 202 against, a majority of 211. *In the Commons chamber, the tellers gave this result as 412 to 202. It was revised later on Parliament\u2019s published division list and has been amended to reflect that. MPs are now voting on the government motion. It says: That this house: (1) notes the resolutions of the house of 12 and 13 March, and accordingly agrees that the government will seek to agree with the European Union an extension of the period specified in article 50(3); (2) agrees that, if the house has passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1) (b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then the government will seek to agree with the European Union a one-off extension of the period specified in article 50(3) for a period ending on 30 June 2019 for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation; and (3) notes that, if the house has not passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then it is highly likely that the European council at its meeting the following day would require a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019 would require the United Kingdom to hold European parliament elections in May 2019. The Labour MP Chris Bryant decides not to press his amendment, which would have ordered the government not to bring the PM\u2019s Brexit deal back for a third vote (see 4.21pm for details) to a vote. MPs have voted down the Labour amendment by 318 votes to 302 - a majority of 16. This is from Labour\u2019s Ruth Smeeth. She has resigned as parliamentary private secretary to Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader. MPs are now voting on the Labour amendment. This is what it says. Leave out paragraphs (2) and (3) and add: \u201c(2) notes that this house has decisively rejected the withdrawal agreement and framework for the future relationship laid before the house and the proposition that the UK should leave the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship; and (3) therefore instructs the prime minister to seek an extension to article 50 in order to avoid exiting the EU on 29 March without a ratified withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship; and to provide parliamentary time for this house to find a majority for a different approach.\u201d. The Benn amendment has been defeated by 314 votes to 312 \u2013 a majority of two. This is from the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, who is an arch-remainer. The Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle voted both for and against the Wollaston amendment. That is normally something MPs do if they want to actively register an abstention. Otherwise, if MPs do not vote in a division, it is not clear whether they have abstained out of choice, whether they were paired, or whether they were unavailable for some other reason. There were also 18 Labour MPs who voted against a second referendum. You can read the names on the division list here. The Lucy Powell amendment to the Hilary Benn amendment has been rejected by 314 votes to 311 - a majority of three. MPs are now voting on the Benn amendment. (See 5.26pm.) But, given the result of the Powell vote, the Benn amendment may struggle to pass. Some 25 Labour MPs voted for the Wollaston amendment calling for a second referendum. You can read the names on the division list here. MPs are now voting on an amendment from Lucy Powell to the Hilary Benn amendment. Here is the text of the Benn amendment. Line 4, leave out from \u201carticle 50 (3)\u201d to end and add: \u201cto enable the House of Commons to find a way forward that can command majority support; 2. orders accordingly that on Wednesday 20 March \u2013 (a) Standing Order No. 14(1) (which provides that government business shall have precedence at every sitting save as provided in that order) shall not apply; (b) precedence shall be given to the motion specified in paragraph 3; (c) the speaker shall interrupt proceedings on any business before the motion specified in paragraph 3 at 1.30pm and call a member to move that motion; (d) debate on that motion may continue until 7.00 pm at which time the Speaker shall put the questions necessary to dispose of proceedings on that motion including the questions on amendments selected by the Speaker which may then be moved; e) any proceedings interrupted or superseded by this order may be resumed or (as the case may be) entered upon and proceeded with after the moment of interruption; and 3. the motion specified in this paragraph is a motion in the name of at least 25 members, including at least five members elected to the House as members of at least five different parties, relating to the business of the house on a future day or days in connection with matters relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. And here is the text of the Powell amendment to the Benn amendment. The Powell amendment is designed to ensure that the process created by the Benn amendment - a debate next Wednesday, on a motion allocating a future day or days for \u201cindicative votes\u201d allowing MPs to find a Brexit alternative - cannot be used beyond the end of June MPs have crushed the second referendum amendment, by 334 votes to 85 - a majority of 249. The Labour MP Wes Streeting and many of his colleagues in favour of a second referendum have written an open letter explaining why they are abstaining. From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush. This is not the first time MPs have voted on a second referendum. There was a division during the committee stage of the EU withdrawal bill in December 2017. Labour abstained on that occasion, as they are doing now, and only 23 MPs voted in favour (including nine Labour MPs who defied the whip). The Lib Dems are voting for the Wollaston amendment. The Lib Dem MP Layla Moran has just posted this picture of the empty aye lobby on Twitter. This is the first time in recent months that MPs have voted on a second referendum. But, with Labour following the People\u2019s Vote advice and not backing the amendment, on the grounds that it is the wrong time for a vote on this issue, it is going to fail badly. If the Wollaston amendment were to pass, then the Benn amendment and the Labour amendment would both fail, and that partly explains why Labour are abstaining. According to Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam, even Labour MPs who are keen on a second referendum are mostly abiding by the orders to abstain. Sarah Wollaston moves her amendment. MPs are voting now. This is what the amendment says: Line 1, leave out from \u201chouse\u201d to end and add \u201cinstructs the prime minister to request an extension to the article 50 period at the European council in March 2019 sufficient for the purposes of legislating for and conducting a public vote in which the people of the United Kingdom may give their consent for either leaving the European Union on terms to be determined by parliament or retaining the United Kingdom\u2019s membership of the European Union.\u201d Barclay claims that Labour is trying to stop Brexit. He says this is a time for responsibility. But Corbyn\u2019s motion ducks responsibility, he says. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is winding up the debate now. He is focusing mostly on Labour, claiming that Labour\u2019s Brexit policy includes proposals that are mutually incompatible. And he says it is inconsistent for Jeremy Corbyn to call for a cross-party approach when he refuses to meet Theresa May. As Labour MPs protest, he corrects himself, and says Corbyn has met May just once. (May has said that she has been trying to schedule a follow-up meeting with Corbyn, but that Corbyn has been unwilling to agree a date.) Blomfield says MPs should not accept the government\u2019s argument that the UK would have to hold European elections for an article 50 extension to go beyond June. He says Lord Keen of Elie, the advocate general for Scotland, said so in the Lords recently. Bomfield quotes Keen, who told peers: The noble Lord\u2019s point that the EU Parliament could sit without the UK having had an election to the European Parliament is correct. In the Commons the Brexit debate is coming to an end. Winding up for Labour, the shadow Brexit minister, Paul Blomfield, criticises the government for trying to get MPs to back a deal already rejected by the Commons twice. He says Theresa May should adopt the approach set out in Labour\u2019s motion, and find a parliamentary majority for a new approach. And he says there should be a public vote on credible Brexit option. Labour would support such a vote, he says. If you are a remainer (well, actually, if you are at all interested in Brexit), you might enjoy a Brexit: What Next for Remainers? Guardian Live event taking place at the Barbican in London on Tuesday next week. There are more details here. Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister and foreign minister, has said the EU may offer the UK a 21-month article 50 extension. In an interview with RTE, he said a long extension was \u201clikely to happen\u201d if there was no agreement in the UK parliament on a deal. If you have a long extension of say 21 months, to the end of 2020, or whatever the period would be, well then Britain has a legal entitlement to have representation in the European parliament. Coveney said that Ireland would not object to an article 50 extension, but that other EU countries might need more convincing. He said: Some of the European prime ministers will be quite demanding, I think. They are open to an extension of time but they want to know in what detail by providing that extension of time how they get certainty. Theresa May chaired a political cabinet today. As is customary these days, it wasn\u2019t long before some snippets emerged. This is from the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott. And this is from the Telegraph\u2019s Stephen Swinford. Conservative Brexiters are to ask a group of lawyers to examine a new proposal to exit the backstop using article 62 of the Vienna convention. (See 9.48am, 1.47pm and 2.35pm.) The ERG will ask lawyers including the QC Martin Howe, the only non-MP on their \u201cstar chamber\u201d of lawyers, to examine how that could work as a unilateral exit mechanism One source in the group sounded pessimistic that it could win broad support. \u201cNo UK government is ever going to break a treaty anyway,\u201d the source said Howe, a member of Lawyers for Britain, has been damning about the possibility and told the Standard that the use of the convention required a \u201cradical change of circumstances\u201d. He said that the international court of justice had considered \u201cthe fall of the Soviet Union, disappearance of the Warsaw Pact and dissolution of Czechoslovakia, were not sufficient to satisfy this ground\u201d. The Labour MP Chris Bryant has tabled an amendment, that will be put to a vote, saying Theresa May should not be allowed to put her deal to MPs again because Commons rules say the house should not be asked to vote on the same proposition during a session. It says: At end, add \u201c (4) notes that Erksine May states that a motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided in the affirmative or negative during the current session may not be brought forward again during that session; and therefore orders the government not to move a further motion asking the house to approve the withdrawal agreement and framework for the future partnership that the house declined to approve on 15 January 2019 and 12 March 2019.\u201d. In a speech in the Commons a few minutes ago Bryant said this rule went back to the time of King John. It was introduced to stop him trying over and over again to get parliament to accept a proposal it had rejected. And it has been cited repeatedly over the years, he said, including to stop George Lansbury pressing for a repeat vote on women\u2019s suffrage. Bryant said that Conservatives, who value tradition, should be in favour of enforcing this rule. John Bercow, the Speaker, was asked in the Commons yesterday if this rule would stop him allowing MV3, the third meaningful vote on May\u2019s plan. He replied: There are historical precedents for the way in such matters are regarded. I do not need to treat of them now and no ruling is required now. There may be people who have an opinion about it. I am not really preoccupied with that, but a ruling would be made about that matter at the appropriate time, and I am grateful to [Angela Eagle] for reminding me that such a ruling might at some point in the future be required. The Press Association has filed more from what Donald Trump said at his meeting with Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister. The US president also said he was opposed to a second referendum on Brexit. He explained: I don\u2019t think another vote would be possible because it would be very unfair to the people that won. They\u2019d say\u201d \u2018What do you mean, you\u2019re going to take another vote?\u2019 So that would be tough. I thought it would happen, it did happen, and both sides are very, very cemented in. It\u2019s a tough situation. It\u2019s a shame. There was no reason for that to happen. They could have had the vote and it should have gone smoothly and unfortunately it didn\u2019t. In opposing a second referendum Trump lines up with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has also said he thinks it would be wrong for the referendum to be rerun. The Press Association has also filed a fuller version of the Trump quote criticising May\u2019s handling of Brexit. He said: I\u2019m surprised at how badly it\u2019s all gone from the standpoint of a negotiation. I gave the prime minister my ideas on how to negotiate it and I think you would have been successful. She didn\u2019t listen to that and that\u2019s fine - she\u2019s got to do what she\u2019s got to do. I think it could have been negotiated in a different manner, frankly. I hate to see everything being ripped apart now. In her speech Yvette Cooper acknowledged that an article 50 extension lasting more than two or three months would clash with the European elections. But she said she did not accept the government\u2019s argument that the UK would inevitably have to elect new MEPs if it wanted to stay in the EU into the summer. She urged MPs to read a thread posted on Twitter by Eleanor Sharpston, an advocate general at the European court of justice. Sharpston showed that other alternatives were available, Cooper said. The thread comes in two parts. The first one starts here. And the second one here. And here are three of her specific tweets. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper is speaking in the Commons now. She is one of the main supporters of the Benn amendment calling for indicative votes and she says the government should have done this a long time ago. She acknowledges that David Lidington unveiled a plan for indicative votes in his speech, but she says this should not be dependent on there being a long article 50 extension and the UK taking part in the European elections. Here are some fuller quotes from what President Trump said during his photocall with Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister. (See 3.52pm.) Trump said Brexit was \u201ctearing countries apart\u201d. He said: It\u2019s a very complex thing right now, it\u2019s tearing a country apart, it\u2019s actually tearing a lot of countries apart and it\u2019s a shame it has to be that way but I think we will stay right in our lane. He criticised May\u2019s handling of Brexit, saying he was \u201csurprised how badly it has all gone\u201d. He said: I\u2019m surprised at how badly it has all gone from a stand point of negotiations but I gave the prime minister my ideas of how to negotiate it, she didn\u2019t listen to that and that\u2019s fine but it could have been negotiated in a different manner. Trump, of course, was a supporter of Brexit. He said he thought Brexit would have to be delayed. He said: I think they are probably going to have to do something because right now they are in the midst of a very short period of time, at the end of the month and they are not going to be able to do that. He said he thought the UK could do \u201ca very big trade deal\u201d with the US after Brexit. In the Commons Sarah Wollaston, the former Tory who is now an Independent Group MP, acknowledges that her second referendum amendment may fail today. But if it does, they can bring it back, she says. She says MPs in favour of the idea should vote for it today, because the Labour front bench may never get round to supporting it, she says. But she also signals that she will bring it back and put it to a vote again next week. In Washington, during a photocall with the Irish prime minister, Leo Varakdar, the US president, Donald Trump, said that he was surprised \u201chow badly\u201d Brexit had gone. \u201cI think it could have been negotiated in a different manner,\u201d he said. Trump also said he did not think a second referendum on Brexit would be possible because it would be \u201cunfair\u201d. Trump criticises May\u2019s handling of Brexit, saying he is surprised \u201chow badly\u201d it has gone. In the Commons debate Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, accused Labour of cowardice for refusing to back another referendum. He said: A shiver has run down the front bench of the Labour party looking for a spine to run up and it has not found one. And the Tory Brexiter Sir Christopher Chope said he would \u201cseriously consider\u201d the issue if Labour brought forward a motion of no confidence in the government. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has signalled her party is ready to do a deal to end the Brexit impasse, saying that the prime minister must prove only that the constitutional integrity of the UK would be preserved, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Nicola Sturgeon has increased the risk of confusing Scottish voters, and her own activists, over her competing strategies in backing a second Brexit referendum and a fresh independence vote. She implied on Sky yesterday she was close to calling for a second independence referendum, because she has a mandate to stage one since the SNP won the most seats in the 2016 Holyrood and 2017 UK elections, and did so on a promise of holding a fresh independence vote if there was a material change in circumstances (in other words, Brexit). Interviewed by Adam Boulton, she said she needed to wait until the current Brexit chaos was over before setting out her plans: And when we get to the end of this current phase of negotiations, which I hope is very soon, then I will set out how I intend to exercise that mandate. Note the use of the word \u201chow\u201d. She did not say \u201cwhether\u201d or \u201cif\u201d she wants to use the mandate. The SNP wanted that message heard: it tweeted out that interview to its 220,000 followers. But there\u2019s a significant timing problem here, which senior figures in her party are well aware of. She can only exercise that existing mandate before May 2021 \u2013 the date of the next Holyrood elections. (The SNP say their primary mandate derives from the Scottish parliament.) And time for that is rapidly running out: the optimum time for a referendum would allow a year to elapse before another election. To hold one by May 2020 means she would need to win Westminster\u2019s approval (highly unlikely to be granted), pass referendum legislation and allow six months for the campaign, in little more than a year. Yet on Thursday she said she actually wanted to see article 50 extended and then a second EU referendum, telling first minister\u2019s questions: \u201cLet\u2019s get no deal properly off the table; let\u2019s seek a lengthy extension to allow this issue to go back to the people.\u201d That appeals to a large number of independence-sceptic moderate and centre-left Scottish voters: many more back EU membership than independence. But resolving these questions could take months; her spokesman acknowledged that after first minister\u2019s questions. So their stance on when she would update Holyrood on her independence plans is subtly changing. She was due to do so by 29 March. It will now come \u201cin due course\u201d and \u201cin the near future\u201d, her spokesman said. Sturgeon is facing a rapidly looming challenge: independence or Europe. She must either disappoint her restless troops or the larger number of voters who want Scotland, and the UK, to remain in the EU (something she wants too). Her senior colleagues know this. And there is a final conundrum: if she succeeds in helping to kill Brexit entirely over the next few months, through attrition or a second EU referendum, then her only rationale for staging a second independence referendum now would die too. Why? Because then that \u201cmaterial change\u201d in Scotland\u2019s circumstances, her mandate, disappears. Best for Britain, the anti-Brexit campaign that favours a second referendum, has put out a statement saying that it does not want MPs to vote for that today. A spokesperson said: Best for Britain, like a majority of the country, believe that giving the people the final say is the only credible solution to the Brexit mess we\u2019ve been left in after three years of government failure and parliamentary gridlock. We believe bringing this issue before parliament today will not truly test the will of the house for a public vote. The debate today must focus on the pressing need for an extension to article 50 to confirm parliament\u2019s rejection of a no deal cliff-edge on 29 March and protect the country from a damaging disorderly exit. We will continue to build on the strong support throughout the country for parliament to give the people the final say. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has been making exactly the same argument. (See 1.25pm.) And here is John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, explaining Labour\u2019s decision to abstain on the Wollaston second referendum amendment later. Turning back to article 62 of the Vienna convention, and the suggestion that it could allow the UK to escape the backstop (see 9.48am and 1.47pm), here are some tweets from Lorand Bartels, a reader in international law at Cambridge University, arguing - well, that this notion is rubbish. Speaking from Washington DC, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has told the BBC that this stage of the Brexit process could be the moment for a deal. Commenting on reports that the DUP have been in talks with Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, about revisions to the backstop legal advice (see 9.48am), she said: It\u2019s not about the attorney general changing his advice. It\u2019s about finding the right deal. It\u2019s about not leaving Northern Ireland behind when the rest of the UK is leaving. Brexit is only two weeks away. When you come to the end of a negotiation, that\u2019s when you really start to see the white\u2019s of people\u2019s eyes and you get to the point of a deal. The Labour MP Lisa Nandy has written a new article for the Guardian explaining why she is opposed to a second referendum. Here is an extract. It is playing with fire to suggest we can settle the defining question of our age, affecting every aspect of our lives, communities and the future of the planet, through a referendum that large numbers passionately believe is illegitimate. In May there will be elections to a new European parliament and if we choose to pursue a referendum Britain will have to take part. The last referendum was ugly and divisive with claims on both sides that were untrue. The debate has since worsened. Cries of traitor, which used to echo around far-right rallies, are routinely heard in Westminster. To re-elect MEPs to a parliament we promised to leave months earlier, while also seeking a referendum in terms that are not considered legitimate by many, is like walking into a room full of explosives with a lit match. We are breaking our democracy. And here is the full article. Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting says there is \u201ca considerable degree of discomfort\u201d among Labour MPs who support a second referendum about the position of some on the Labour frontbench. He asks if the party will give wholehearted support to the Kyle/Wilson plan for a confirmatory second referendum (ie, backing a Brexit deal, subject to it being put to a public vote) if it comes to a vote. \u201cYes,\u201d says Starmer. Challenged about Labour\u2019s failure to support the second referendum amendment, Starmer says: It is obvious that we are supportive of the principle. It\u2019s a question of timing. Labour sources are confirming that its MPs will be whipped to abstain on the Wollaston second referendum amendment \u2013 which is what Starmer effectively said in the Commons a few moments ago, although he did not put it in those terms. Here is the Plaid Cyrmu MP Jonathan Edwards on Labour not backing the Wollaston second referendum amendment. Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw says many Labour MPs will be tempted to vote for the Wollaston second referendum. He says, although Starmer is in favour, other senior people in the party give out different messages on this topic. Starmer says he has always tried to speak with a clear voice on this. The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, says we are now two weeks away from Brexit. He says MPs now have the chance to vote for a second referendum. Labour will be found out for what they are, \u201ca fraud\u201d, he says. SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford calls Labour \u201ca fraud\u201d because it is not voting for a second referendum. Starmer says Blackford\u2019s question was good rhetoric, but empty of substance. In the chamber Anna Soubry, the former Tory who is now an Independent Group MP, asks Starmer how Labour will vote on the Wollaston second referendum amendment. Starmer says he has played a role in pushing Labour towards a public vote. But today is about getting an article 50 extension. He says the People\u2019s Vote campaign has said today is not the day for MPs to back a second referendum. (See 1.25pm.) He quotes Alastair Campbell. (See 12.57pm.) This is from the Labour MP Helen Hayes, justifying a Labour decision not to vote for a second referendum amendment today. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is responding now for Labour He says a simple motion calling for an extension to article 50, to allow more time for MPs to agree a Brexit solution, would pass by a hefty majority. But he says the government has included in its motion a suggestion MPs should back Theresa May\u2019s deal again. That makes it divisive, he says. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry intervenes, and asks Starmer what he thinks about suggestions that Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, may argue that article 62 of the Vienna convention could be used to argue that the UK could not be trapped in the backstop. (See 9.48am.) Starmer says the idea that the government could use the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of \u201ccrashing the treaty\u201d came to him as a surprise. He says he would be surprised if Cox were to argue this. He says breaking a treaty has consequences in international law. The UK could be taken to court, he says. Lidington is now talking about the Labour amendment. It says the government should extend article 50 \u201cto provide parliamentary time for this house to find a majority for a different approach\u201d. Lidington says this is unnecessary. He says MPs have already debated Labour\u2019s Brexit approach, and rejected it. And this is from the Telegraph\u2019s Stephen Swinford, on government whipping. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. Back in the Commons Lidington is now talking about the Hilary Benn amendment. He says it is undemocratic, because it allows a day to be set aside for debate on a non-government motion provided it is backed by at least 25 MPs, including MPs from five different parties. (This is the motion that Benn intends to be used to create the mechanism for an \u201cindicative votes\u201d process.) Lidington says this effectively gives the minor parties in the Commons a veto, because their support would be needed for the motion to be allowed. He says a much larger number of MPs from a single party could back an alternative motion, but it would not be allowed under the Benn procedure. You can read the text of the Benn amendment on this document (pdf). The People\u2019s Vote campaign has now put out a statement echoing Alastair Campbell\u2019s tweet (see 12.57am), arguing that now is not the time for MPs to vote for a second referendum. A spokesman for the campaign said: The People\u2019s Vote campaign does not instruct its supporters in parliament on how to vote. We recognise there is a range of opinions on when to press the case for the public being given the final say, which means some of these MPs will vote for the Wollaston amendment, some may vote against, and some will abstain. But we do not think today is the right time to test the will of the house on the case for a new public vote. Instead, this is the time for parliament to declare it wants an extension of article 50 so that, after two-and-a-half years of vexed negotiations, our political leaders can finally decide on what Brexit means. That is because a People\u2019s Vote is not just another option in this Brexit crisis \u2013 it is a solution to this crisis. When the real costs of Brexit are measured up against the broken promises made for it in 2016, we believe Parliament will have better opportunities to decide it is only fair and reasonable to give the public a real say on this crucial decision for our country. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. If Labour does abstain on the Wollaston second referendum amendment, that may provoke a backlash amongst some second referendum supporters because after Labour\u2019s Brexit plan was voted down two weeks ago, the party said it was ready to \u201csupport or table an amendment in favour of a public vote\u201d. But I say \u201csome second referendum supporters\u201d because leading figures in the People\u2019s Vote campaign think that now is not the time for a parliamentary decision on a second referendum. (See 12.57am.) The Brexit department has published a short, two-page note setting out the thinking behind the government\u2019s motion today. It is here (pdf). Lidington says, if the UK wants to delay Brexit beyond the European elections (which take place at the end of May), the UK would have to take part in those elections. The Tory pro-European Antoinette Sandbach asks if he has looked at the legal view suggesting the UK could follow the Croatian example. Croatia found an alternative to holding elections. But that was when it was joining the EU, Lidington says. This is what David Lidington said a moment ago about the government allowing \u201cindicative votes\u201d to allow MPs to agree an alternative approach if no deal is passed by the time of the EU summit starting next Thursday. He said: If [passing a deal by next Wednesday] proves, for whatever reason, not to be possible, we would be faced with the prospect of choosing only a long extension during which the house would need to face up to the choices in front of it, and the consequences of the decisions that it has taken: that the government recognises that the house will require time to consider the potential ways forward in such a scenario. I can conform today that in such a scenario the government, having consulted the usual channels at that time, would facilitate a process in the two weeks after the March European council to allow the house to seek a majority on the way forward. But we should be clear about the consequences if that were to happen. If we are in the world of a longer extension, for this house to come to a decision, then we will be required as a condition to hold European parliamentary elections in May. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief and a leading supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, says it is wrong for Sarah Wollaston to push her second referendum amendment today. Lidington is now explaining the government motion. (See 12.41pm.) He says, if MPs do not pass a Brexit deal by the time of the EU summit starting next week, the government will let MPs find an alternative way forward in the following two weeks. But he says this would be on the assumption that the EU would grant a longer article 50 extension, which would require the UK to take part in the European elections. Lidington says, if the government needs to go for a longer article 50 extension, it will allow MPs to find an alternative way forward. He is implying the government would use an \u201cindicative votes\u201d process. Here is the text of the government motion That this house: (1) notes the resolutions of the house of 12 and 13 March, and accordingly agrees that the government will seek to agree with the European Union an extension of the period specified in article 50(3); (2) agrees that, if the house has passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1) (b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then the government will seek to agree with the European Union a one-off extension of the period specified in article 50(3) for a period ending on 30 June 2019 for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation; and (3) notes that, if the house has not passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then it is highly likely that the European council at its meeting the following day would require a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019 would require the United Kingdom to hold European parliament elections in May 2019. The DUP MP Ian Paisley asks about Michael Gove\u2019s claim yesterday that a no-deal Brexit could lead to the return of direct rule. Lidington says he did not hear what Gove said yesterday, but he says Gove can answer questions on this. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, is opening the debate for the government. Labour\u2019s Ian Murray asks if the government will bring \u201cmeaningful vote three\u201d to the Commons before 20 March. Lidington says he will explain the motion in due course. The Labour MP Caroline Flint uses a point of order to say she is pleased Bercow has selected the Wollaston amendment for a second referendum. She says it is the first chance that MPs will get to vote against the idea. The Tory Brexiter Mark Francois used a point of order to complain about Bercow\u2019s failure to call the Lee Rowley amendment ruling out a second referendum. It has been signed by more than 100 MPs. Bercow will not go into detail about why he did not select it, but he says sometimes MPs are disappointed by his selection of amendments. John Bercow, the speaker, says he is calling four amendments, plus an amendment to an amendment. They are: 1) Sarah Wollaston\u2019s - calling for an extension to article 50 to allow for time for a referendum on Brexit. 2) Hilary Benn\u2019s - saying next Wednesday should be set aside for a debate that would start the process of allowing MPs to hold indicative votes on Brexit alternatives. There is also an amendment to this amendment, from Labour\u2019s Lucy Powell, changing the timing. 3) Labour\u2019s - saying article 50 should be extended to allow time for MPs to find a majority for a different approach to Brexit. 4) Chris Bryant\u2019s - saying Theresa May should not be allowed to put her deal to the Commons again. The pro-European Tory Ken Clarke told Sky News that the government should ask the EU for a long delay to article 50, so that it can rethink Brexit. He said: I think we should suggest to the Europeans a good, long delay. Go back to square one and work out ... over a proper time, the final relationship. Here is a Commons document (pdf) with the full list of amendments to the main Brexit motion - including those not on the order paper because they were submitted late. Labour will not be backing a second referendum amendment tonight, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has told ITV. We don\u2019t know yet which amendments are being called - we will find out what the debate starts, in the next few minutes - but at least four of the amendments do propose a second referendum. The Labour MP Chris Bryant has tabled a manuscript amendment to today\u2019s motion that would stop Theresa May putting her deal to a vote again, the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom reports. This is from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. MV3 is the third meaningful vote - Theresa May\u2019s next attempt to get MPs to back her deal. In a column in this week\u2019s Spectator, Forsyth says there is speculation that May could give her MPs a free vote on MV3. Another theory doing the rounds among cabinet ministers is that May could make the next meaningful vote a free vote. It might seem bizarre to suggest that the way for the Prime Minister to win approval for her deal is to relax the whip. But advocates of this approach argue that the government doesn\u2019t have much to lose: pretty much every Tory MP who wants to rebel already has. A free vote, however, would feel less partisan. This might encourage more opposition MPs to vote for the agreement. Tory whips suspect there are about 70 Labour MPs who don\u2019t want a second referendum, and who might be joined by another 30 prepared to vote for May\u2019s deal if they thought it might break the impasse. This is, essentially, what Ted Heath did in 1971. He offered a free vote for Conservative MPs on entry into the European Economic Community to make it easier for Labour MPs (such as Roy Jenkins) to back the government. There must have been something about Brexit on Fox News this morning, because Donald Trump has decided to tweet a message that seems intended to cheer Brexiters. We\u2019ve had a fairly long and largely unilluminating lobby briefing with Theresa May\u2019s spokesman ahead of the latest Brexit debate. We have learned that May herself will not speak in today\u2019s debate \u2013 her voice is still bad \u2013 and it will be opened by her de facto deputy, David Lidington. The closing address will be from Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary. He will also make the usual point of order after the vote to announce the next steps. There is also a political cabinet taking place at Downing Street at 1.30pm, we were told. No official news on whether there will be a new meaningful vote on Monday or Tuesday next week \u2013 although that seems inevitable. Here are some of the names on the Hilary Benn manuscript amendment. (See 10.53am.) Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter and vice chair of the European Research Group, told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show earlier that it was hard to see how Theresa May was really in power given that some cabinet ministers defied a three-line whip last night and refused to vote against the motion ruling out a no-deal Brexit for good. He said: If you do not have collective responsibility, ministers are supposed to support each other work together as a government. This is how our constitution works. Under our constitution, if a minister cannot support the policy of the government, they have to resign, which is what Sarah Newton honourably did. Collective responsibility fell off its horse and died [last night]. It\u2019s not the fault of the whips\u2019 office. They are not giving the orders. You may as well dissolve the whips\u2019 office and send them all off for a two-year holiday ... When you have ministers who openly defy the prime minister, who openly defy a three-line whip, and nothing happens to them, you have to ask yourself, \u2018Are you really in power?\u2019 Indeed, \u2018Are you really in office?\u2019 Francois also said this: I have seen better run parish councils than what I saw in the House of Commons last night. ... which is horribly unfair on parish councils. In the Commons, during the business statement a few minutes ago, the Tory Brexiter Sir Edward Leigh asked for a debate on the possibility that the UK could use article 62 of the Vienna convention to exit the backstop. (See 9.48am.) Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, had already considered this matter. But then she added, cryptically: \u201cI\u2019m sure if he has more to say on this matter, he will come to the house to say it.\u201d This is from Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman. He is opposed to a long article 50 extension of the kind proposed by Donald Tusk. (See 9.11am.) He made the same argument at greater length in a speech in the European parliament yesterday. One problem for the Verhofstadt is that decisions to extend article 50 are taken by the European council, which is chaired by Tusk, not the European parliament. Another problem, as my colleague Daniel Boffey reports, is that MEPs are divided on this point. ITV\u2019s Paul Brand has details of the new Hilary Benn amendment to the Brexit motion being debated later. It would set aside next Wednesday for a debate on \u201cindicative votes\u201d on Brexit alternatives. This is from Labour whips, an official account. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is announcing the Commons business for next week. She has not timetabled a Brexit debate next week - even though the government motion being debated later sets Wednesday as the deadline for Theresa May\u2019s deal to be passed. These are from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, says Theresa May should agree to a long article 50 extension, as Donald Tusk is proposing (see 9.11am), and develop an alternative approach to Brexit. Nigel Evans, a Tory Brexiter, said this morning that Theresa May needs to reassert her authority after some cabinet ministers defied a three-line whip and refused to vote against the motion last night ruling out a no-deal Brexit for good. He said: [May\u2019s] authority was openly defied by cabinet ministers and other ministers. She needs to reassert her authority. We have to have collective responsibility in government, otherwise it just simply doesn\u2019t work. Apparently cabinet ministers were confused last night as to whether they were on a three-line whip or not. Well, funnily enough, I received a text that told me on my phone that I was on a three-line whip. They received the same text. It\u2019s amazing that you can be a cabinet minister and still not know what a three-line whip text means. You can read today\u2019s order paper here (pdf). The government motion being debated today, and the amendments tabled overnight (eight of them) are all there, starting on page 6. Helpfully, my colleague Peter Walker has written a summary of what all the amendments say. It is here. But the speaker, John Bercow, has also said he will consider manuscript amendments (last minute ones submitted on the day, hence not printed on the order paper) because the government motion went down late. (Amendments cannot be tabled until the motion has gone down.) As the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar reports, there may be one from Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn. Bercow will announce which amendments are being put to a vote at the start of the debate, after 11.10am. George Freeman, a Conservative former minister and chair of the prime minister\u2019s policy board until the end of 2017, has said that Theresa May should offer to resign after Brexit to help persuade Tory MPs to back her deal. The call for a commitment from May to resign is not based on vindictiveness (or not just vindictiveness). If the UK leaves the EU in the next few months, Brexit will not be over. Arguably it will just be starting, because the talks on the UK\u2019s future trade relationship with the EU are expected to be longer and more acrimonious than the negotiations we have had so far. The UK\u2019s ultimate aim is still, to a large extent, unresolved and there are some Tory Brexiters who want to know that someone more attuned to their way of thinking will be in charge. On Tuesday Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, published his legal advice on the new backstop assurances obtained by the prime minister and his harsh conclusion - \u201cthe legal risk [of being kept in the backstop] remains unchanged\u201d - sunk any slim chance Theresa May had of winning the vote on her deal. But, as my colleagues Rowena Mason and Rajeev Syal report in their overnight story, what was published on Tuesday was not the final word. The DUP and the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, are exploring whether Cox can give a view on whether article 62 of the Vienna convention could give the UK a let-out from the backstop. Article 62 says that, if there is a fundamental change of circumstances, a treaty can no longer apply. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, told Sky News, in a clip broadcast a moment ago, that talks on this issue were taking place. She said: We are in conversations with the government. We\u2019ll keep those conversations going because we want to get a deal ... I think we need to finish those conversations before we decide what we\u2019re going to do. And Damian Green, the Conservative former first secretary of state, told Sky News that he had heard the DUP were \u201cnot far away\u201d from getting the reassurance they needed. Talking about the talks between Cox and the DUP, Green said: I hear noises that it\u2019s possibly close, that they are not far away from getting what they want. If Cox does revise his advice to take account of article 62 of the Vienna convention, it will be surprising. He was asked about this in the Commons on Tuesday and, while he acknowledge that article 62 applied, he suggested it would be \u201cunwise\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d to think it would help the UK with the backstop issue. Philippe Sands, the law professor who says he has argued this point at the international court of justice, also says he does not see how article 62 would allow the UK to get out of the backstop. But when Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was asked about this on the Today programme, he suggested that Cox might revise his thinking by taking into account the views of other lawyers. Hammond said: The attorney general\u2019s legal view is clearly very important and this is a very complex agreement and many other eminent lawyers are coming out with views and interpretations. And I\u2019m sure the attorney general will want to consider very carefully all the evidence, all the qualified opinion that there is around this issue. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has just posted this on Twitter. This is probably helpful to Theresa May, because it reinforces the argument that she is making to MPs that, if they fail to vote for her deal, she will have no choice but to seek a long extension of article 50. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. For the third day in a row, we have a big Brexit vote. Tuesday\u2019s was the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d (yes/no on the deal), yesterday\u2019s was on ruling out no deal, and today\u2019s is on extending article 50. And, as Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen reports, Downing Street is giving Tory MPs a free vote. This is not surprising given the extent of divisions in the Conservative party, but it is fresh evidence that Theresa May is finding it increasingly hard to govern through the conventional mechanism of parliamentary whipping. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom says a no-deal Brexit has not been taken off the table despite the votes last night. Speaking to reporters she warned that European members states could refuse an extension or insist on a long extension. She said: What we are seeking to do today is to get the will of parliament on what it does want. If does want to extend article 50. And if that what parliament decides then the prime minister will go to the EU and seek an extension. But the really important point here is that she can\u2019t insist on it, and the EU may well have ideas of their own either to refuse or indeed to put conditions on it. So by no means is any option off the table at present. Stephen Hammond, a health minister who abstained on the no-deal vote, claimed ministers were given assurances that they would not be sacked if they defied the government whip in this way. \u201cI personally had not been [given assurances] I believe some colleagues may have been,\u201d he told the Today programme. He said he could name the ministers involved. Hammond added: Yesterday was a day of many contradictions. Initially there were two amendments both against government policy. One was a free vote, one was whipped against. I voted against it in the hope that I could vote for the prime minister\u2019s motion last night to make sure there was a smooth and orderly Brexit and there would not be a no-deal on 29 March. Conservative MP Johnny Mercer tweeted a screengrab of some abuse he\u2019d received over the latest Commons vote. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has urged MPs on all sides to seek a Brexit compromise. Speaking to Sky News he said: The problem with the prime minister\u2019s approach is that she hasn\u2019t come to parliament and sought a compromise. She came to parliament and basically said \u2018my deal or no deal\u2019 and she\u2019s threaten parliament. And MPs on all political parties said \u2018we\u2019re not having that\u2019. Yesterday Philip Hammond said he would oppose a no-deal and he was interested in compromise, then he disappeared, he never voted against no-deal. What we are saying to Philip Hammond is \u2018you and other MPs in your party are looking for a compromise join us now in working through that compromise\u2019.\u201d On the prospects for a second referendum, McDonnell said: I think what will happen is exactly Labour party conference decided. First of all we have got to prevent a reckless deal that the Conservatives are bringing forward [and] make sure we prevent a no-deal. We want a general election if we can\u2019t get that, we have said we will bring our own deal forward and then if necessary, once parliament has agreed deal, if some MPs we will only vote for this if it goes back to the people, that will have to be the case. Asked about what kind of compromise Labour was seeking, McDonnell said: Jeremy Corbyn has already met those [Conservative] MPs who are looking at the Norway model. Our own proposals are most probably the bedrock of a compromise that can be achieved because they got quite a warm response from Brussels. Let\u2019s try and get a compromise. There may now be a willingness in parliament that there wasn\u2019t before. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has defended his decision to obey the government whip and vote in favour of a no-deal last night despite his objection to such an outcome. Speaking to Sky News he predicted that his cabinet colleagues who abstained on the vote would not be sacked. Asked if no-deal has now been taken off the table as a result of the two votes last night, Hammond said: No deal on the 29 March is off the table. The problem with so called amendment A which Yvette Cooper moved last night, that the House of Commons collectively stamping its foot and saying \u2018no no deal\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually answer the question how do we deliver this outcome because the default in our legislation is no deal. And the prime minister has always been abundantly clear about this. The choices are, no deal, no Brexit or the deal. You can\u2019t just say \u2018we don\u2019t want no deal\u2019 without saying whether you are going to achieve that by having a deal or by having no Brexit. On cabinet members defying the three-line whip, he blamed \u201cconfusion\u201d. Hammond said: A number of colleagues abstained on the final motion. We had a difficult situation. We were all expecting to have a free vote on the government\u2019s motion where people could have expressed their view about leaving on 29 March. I would, of course, have voted for it, rejecting the idea of leaving on the 29 March with no deal. But because of the amendment that option was not presented to us. Some of us felt that we had to follow the logic of having already voting against amendment A, and carry that through and vote against it again. Others felt they couldn\u2019t do that because they wanted to clearly show their support for the view that no deal is not a good outcome. It was a very difficult and confused situation because people had been offered a free vote on the government\u2019s motion and once the government\u2019s motion became amended there was some confusion about what the position was. I don\u2019t expect there to be mass sackings as a result of last night. I told the House of Commons that I would support the government\u2019s motion, but I voted against amendment A because it is a unicorn, because it proposes something without delivering a means. Hammond says \u201cconfused\u201d situation led to ministers ignoring three-line whip last night. Asked about his calls suggesting a cross party approach for a softer Brexit, Hammond said: That\u2019s what some of my colleagues who voted against the prime minister\u2019s deal need to think very carefully about. It is clear that the prime minister has to find a consensus around something and if isn\u2019t the prime minister\u2019s deal, I think it is likely to be something which is much less to the taste of those on the hard Brexit wing of my party. On the prospect of the speaker denying a third vote meaningful vote, Hammond said: If there is clear evidence that there is a body of support growing for the prime minister\u2019s deal, then the House of Commons will find a way to allow that support to be expressed. Quite a number of colleagues changed their minds on this issue between the January vote and the vote earlier this week. And talks continue and some of my colleagues will be thinking very hard about what the alternatives are now. On the extension to article 50, Hammond said: The European Union is signalling that only if we have a deal is it likely to be willing to grant a short technical extension to get the legislation through. If we don\u2019t have a deal ... then it is quite possible that the EU may insist on a significantly longer period. And again that will be point at which those of my colleagues who voted against the prime minister\u2019s deal need to think very hard about how they want to proceed. Andrew Bridgen, one of the members of the ERG who has twice oted against Theresa May\u2019s deal, appears in no mood to change his mind in a third meaningful vote. Speaking on the Today programme he accused May of adopting a \u201cscorched earth policy\u201d by trying to take out every option apart from her withdrawal agreement. He described the deal as a Hotel California Brexit from which the UK could never leave the EU. And he accused the Commons of frustrating the will of the British people and added: \u201cI can\u2019t see this parliament staggering on\u201d. My colleagues Heather Stewart and Rajeev Syal have this devastating assessment of May\u2019s cabinet in chaos yesterday, which, as the Guardian reports on its front page, \u201cruptured three ways... in an unprecedented night of Tory splits.\u201d It begins: Throughout yet another neuralgic day of Brexit debate at Westminster, the deep divisions in the Conservative party were again on excruciating display. Collective responsibility has long been suspended, as shifting groups of ministers and backbenchers pursue their own favoured Brexit outcome. But the chaotic votes of Wednesday night smacked of a government falling apart. First, six cabinet ministers most notable for their leadership ambitions \u2013 Gavin Williamson, Jeremy Hunt, Alun Cairns, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Sajid Javid \u2013 supported the Malthouse compromise, a policy that would involve junking the deal their own government had spent two years negotiating. And then a separate group of cabinet ministers, David Mundell, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke, abstained in the face of a three-line whip, rather than vote against the amended motion taking no deal off the table. \u2018The best turd we\u2019ve got\u2019 - and other attempts to explain Brexit This is from last night, but worth re-visiting, because we all need a chuckle in this absolute dumpster fire of a week. There have been some remarkable turns of phrase from commentators and politicians in their attempts to capture just what exactly has gone on in British politics in the last few days. The most quotable quote from an MP on Brexit in a while (forever?) came from Conservative backbencher Steve Double who said in parliament on Tuesday: This is a turd of a deal, which has now been taken away and polished, and is now a polished turd. But it might be the best turd that we\u2019ve got. This is also pretty good from Tom Peck at the Indy, who says: The House of Commons was a Benny Hill chase on acid, running through a Salvador Dali painting in a spaceship on its way to infinity. It has got us wondering about the best Brexit analogies, or attempts to explain Brexit that have come out over the months/years. Any favourites? Let me know in the comments or on Twitter. This one springs to mind: More great questions pouring in, thanks so much everyone for getting in touch. One question from a reader is very easy to answer, he asks when the vote will be held tonight and whether the country is in for \u201canother dose of indigestion at 7pm\u201d. Ken, you\u2019ll be relieved to hear that tonight\u2019s vote will be held at 5pm, so you\u2019ve only got 10 more hours of indigestion and anxiety to wait through. My colleague, Jennifer Rankin, has this excellent Q&amp;A that explains how an extension to article 50 would work. There\u2019s much more to it, you can read the full thing here, but here are some highlights: How would an extension work? Extending Brexit is a job for EU leaders, say numerous diplomatic sources. The EU\u2019s 27 heads of state and government would have to decide unanimously at an EU summit on Thursday 21 March. But first the UK has to ask. The EU cannot consider the question until the British government makes a formal request to extend article 50. Would the EU say yes? Probably. While any single country has the right to block a Brexit extension, most diplomats think the EU would agree, although this cannot be taken for granted. The wildcard is that EU leaders have never discussed the issue and often take a stricter line than officials. In December, for example, EU leaders decided it would be pointless granting the UK further legal assurances on the Irish backstop, concluding that another legal paper was unlikely to sway MPs in favour of a Brexit treaty. It turned out they were right. But blocking an extension could be seen as tantamount to forcing the UK to leave the EU without a deal. The EU does not want to go down in history with the blame for Brexit. And the British request matters: the UK must be able to show \u201ca credible justification for a possible extension and its duration\u201d, a spokesman for the European council president, Donald Tusk, has said. What is a \u2018credible justification\u2019? That\u2019s not entirely clear. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has said he opposes \u201cany extension of article 50, even just for 24 hours, if it is not based on a clear majority from the House of Commons in favour of something\u201d. Some EU sources say \u201ccredible justification\u201d means time to hold a general election or a referendum. Others have no fixed view, and member states don\u2019t want to be boxed in with strict criteria. How long? A short \u201ctechnical\u201d extension of two to three months to allow parliament to pass Brexit legislation would have been easy to agree if MPs had voted for the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Now the deal has gone down in flames, the EU faces a dilemma. A short extension is seen as heightening the chances of the UK tumbling out of the EU just before European elections. But a long extension means the EU could be bogged down in Brexit for months or years, while numerous foreign and economic policy problems are jostling for attention. Various options have been mooted, from three to 21 months, but there is no fixed view. Some very touching responses have come in overnight from MPs (and members of the public) wishing well to Andrew Gwynne, Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, who tweeted that he would not be able to attend last night\u2019s vote because his seven-week-old grandson was being transferred to ICU. Other MPs, including Jess Phillips, Stella Creasy, Hilary Benn, Liz Kendall, Anna Turley, Albert Owen, Lisa Nandy, Caroline Flint, and many more, tweeted their support for Gwynne, wishing his family well and saying they understood and supported his decision to be with his family rather than to be at parliament. A questions has come in from a reader \u2013 thanks so much and do get in touch if you have a thought or question for the blog, I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll know the answer, but I promise to read your comments! \u2013 asking the following: Can you explain the likelihood of the EU agreeing an extension in the short (June) or longer term? The former seems palatable to the EU the latter does not. Therefore if we are in a position where we have no deal agreed and the EU reject a longer extension. What then? Great question. Last night Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said he hopes the UK will eventually agree on a constructive proposal, but the EU needs an answer now. He says the UK has to explain why an extension should be granted. He says the EU cannot grant an extension until it gets an answer. They have to tell us what it is they want for their future relationship. What will their choice be, what will be the line they will take? That is the question we need a clear answer to now. That is the question that has to be answered before a decision on a possible further extension. Why would we extend these discussions? The discussion on article 50 is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement. It is there. That is the question asked and we are waiting for an answer to that. Barnier says the EU cannot grant an article 50 extension until it knows why the UK wants one. \u2018Chaos reigns\u2019 - How the papers covered Wednesday\u2019s no-deal votes \u201cHumiliation\u201d and \u201cmeltdown\u201d are two words that are repeated across many of the front pages after another bruising day for Theresa May, in which key cabinet members defied the party whip and the prime minister suffered further defeats. Good morning and welcome to Politics live. This is Kate Lyons kicking things off as politicians return to the Commons for yet another day of voting on yet more Brexit motions. Last night, we saw dramatic scenes in the House. Theresa May issued her MPs with an ultimatum; back her deal, or face a long delay to Brexit. But her authority within her party is vanishing. Last night\u2019s events were a total and humiliating shambles for the Conservative parliamentary party and the prime minister, as May was openly defied by ministers who abstained rather than follow the party whip. The result of last night\u2019s votes, however, means the threat of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March has almost certainly been removed. As many commentators have pointed out, this is virtually unprecedented; normally, open defiance from cabinet ministers like we saw last night, would lead to them being strongly disciplined, and repeated losses in significant votes would see the PM step down. Today, the vote is about extending Article 50. Parliament will vote on a motion that sets next Wednesday as the deadline for MPs to pass a Brexit deal. It says, if a deal is passed by then, the government will seek an extension of article 50 until 30 June. But if the deal is not passed by then, then the government will need a longer extension, requiring the UK to take part in European elections. It\u2019s been a huge and exhausting week of Brexit news. Stay turned as we endeavour to keep you updated, and make sense of this craziness. Once again, I\u2019ll be kicking things off and would love to hear from you - contact me in the comments, on Twitter, or via email kate.lyons@theguardian.com - and I\u2019ll be holding the fort until my colleagues Matthew Weaver and Andrew Sparrow take over later on. All set? Let\u2019s dive in.",

      "bodyText": "David Steel has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats after admitting he was aware that Cyril Smith was a child abuser but failed to assess whether he was a risk to children. Party officials decided on Thursday night that Lord Steel, the former leader of the Liberal party, should have the whip withdrawn and face a formal investigation. It follows an outcry over the peer\u2019s testimony to an inquiry that in 1979 the late MP for Rochdale confirmed reports that he had assaulted children. Rather than launch an investigation into Smith, Steel said he allowed him to continue in office and waved through a recommendation for a knighthood. Steel also appeared on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme last year and claimed allegations against Smith were \u201ctittle tattle\u201d. Smith went on to abuse a number of other boys after 1979, victims have claimed. In a statement on Thursday night, the office bearers of the Scottish Lib Dems said they had studied Steel\u2019s testimony to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and decided to launch a formal inquiry. Vince Cable, the party\u2019s leader, praised the swift action of the committee. Steel defended his decision not to investigate Smith and claimed the media had generated \u201csensationalist headlines\u201d by distorting his testimony to the inquiry. \u201cIt is unfortunate that some sections of the media have chosen to extract certain passages of evidence and present them without the full context,\u201d he said. Smith stepped down as an MP in 1992 and died in 2010. He faced claims that he abused young boys from the 1960s to the 1980s. Under questioning at the inquiry, Steel said he confronted Smith about the allegations of child sexual abuse in 1979 after reading them in Private Eye. Young boys in Rochdale children\u2019s homes had said that their local MP had stripped, spanked and bathed their buttocks, and fondled their genitals, the magazine reported. Steel told the inquiry he questioned Smith about the allegations during a meeting in the House of Commons. \u201cWhat I said to him was: \u2018What\u2019s all this about you in Private Eye?\u2019 \u201cHe said, rather to my surprise, \u2018It is correct\u2019 that he had been in charge of or had some supervisory role in a children\u2019s hostel, that he\u2019d been investigated by the police, and that they had taken no further action, and that was the end of the story,\u201d the peer said. Allegations of sexual assault by Smith had been investigated by Lancashire police in 1969 but no action was taken. Steel said that he did not question Smith further about specific child abuse claims but concluded that the allegations were true. The inquiry counsel, Brian Altman QC, asked: \u201cSo you understood that he\u2019d actually committed these offences, from what he said to you?\u201d Steel responded: \u201cI assumed that.\u201d Steel said he did not ask the party to launch any form of formal inquiry into Smith because the alleged incidents had already been investigated by police and took place before Smith was voted in as an MP in 1972 and before he joined the Liberal party. He later went on to pass a recommendation that Smith should receive a knighthood in 1988, which was successful. Steel, the son of a Scottish church minister, was the Liberal leader from 1976 to 1981, led the party into an alliance with the SDP and served as an MSP from 1999 to 2003. He has been a life peer since 1997. Responding to Steel\u2019s suspension, Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon which represents some of Smith\u2019s alleged victims, said: \u201cMy clients will welcome the news that Steel is finally being made to face the consequences of his inaction. \u201cHis failure to stop Smith in 1979, allowing him to go on and abuse more young boys, is inexcusable and he must be held to account.

To allow him to keep it will be seen by victims as condoning his behaviour.\u201d One of Smith\u2019s victims, now in his 70s, gave evidence to the inquiry last year over the abuse he suffered. Following the inquiry\u2019s hearing on Wednesday, he said: \u201cI would love to have a debate with Steel face to face. To ask him why he did nothing. \u201cTo me he is just as guilty because as the party\u2019s leader he had the opportunity to stop Smith and he didn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Tusk is pushing the European Union\u2019s leaders to consider a long Brexit delay to allow the UK to rethink its goals in the negotiations as the Commons voted in favour of seeking an extension of article 50. In an apparent shift in the EU\u2019s red lines, the European council president suggested even before MPs had voted that a lengthy extension beyond 29 March could be granted simply to give Westminster time to recalibrate. Officials have until now insisted that only calling a general election or second referendum could justify delaying Brexit beyond more than a few months. \u201cDuring my consultations ahead of [the EU leaders\u2019 summit next week], I will appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it,\u201d Tusk tweeted. However, a European commission spokesman expressed the concerns in Brussels over the impact of a long extension after MPs voted 413 to 202 to push back Brexit to at least 30 June. \u201cA request for an extension of article 50 requires the unanimous agreement of all 27 member states,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt will be for the European councilto consider such a request, giving priority to the need to ensure the functioning of the EU institutions and taking into account the reasons for and duration of a possible extension.\u201d Reacting to the vote, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, made clear his frustration. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of whining on for months on end while we have been going around in circles for two years?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Theresa May comes asking us for an extension, our response will be: \u2018For what? To what end?\u201d However, delays of between a few weeks to as long as 21 months have been mooted in recent weeks, with the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, being the latest on Thursday to suggest that a lengthy delay could be helpful despite the complications. \u201cIf you have a long extension of article 50, that opens up the debate in a much broader way to the overall approach that the United Kingdom takes to Brexit. That may facilitate a fundamental rethink, it may not, we just don\u2019t know,\u201d Coveney said. \u201cIf you have a long extension of, say 21 months to the end of 2020 \u2013 whatever the period would be \u2013 then Britain has a legal entitlement to have representation in the European parliament.\u201d Detlef Seif, the Brexit point person for the Christian Democrat party of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and that party\u2019s leader, Annegret-Kramp Karrenbauer, told the Guardian the European commission could even relax its refusal to negotiate the terms of a future trade deal during such a 21-month extension in order to \u201crebuild trust\u201d. \u201cI agree with [EU deputy chief negotiator] Sabine Weyand that the much-discussed technical solution for doing customs checks without the infrastructure of a hard border don\u2019t yet exist,\u201d said Seif. \u201cBut if Theresa May were to submit a declaration to Brussels in which she stated her intention to spend the next 21 months developing such technical solutions in order to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, then that should suffice to grant an extension.\u201d To make an extension more attractive to hardliners in the Conservative party, Seif added that the EU should loosen its red lines around talks over the future relationship. \u201cIt was right to rule out talks about the future relationship in the early stages of the negotiations, since the Brits showed very clearly that they would not have talked about their financial obligations otherwise.

We are getting to a place where both sides are expecting the worst of each other \u2013 it\u2019s time to rebuild trust.\u201d Tusk\u2019s move to back a potential lengthy extension will be seen by some as an attempt to help May scare Brexiters into supporting her deal or face a prolonged extra period of EU membership during which the risk of a softer Brexit or second referendum would rise. But it also reflects the concern that a short extension of a few months would not resolve any of the issues in Westminster, making a no-deal scenario likely this summer. The 27 heads of state and government are not agreed on the issue of an extension but would need to come to a unanimous view when they meet at the summit in Brussels on 21 and 22 March. Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, who is the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: \u201cUnder no circumstances an extension in the dark! Unless there is a clear majority in the House of Commons for something precise, there is no reason at all for the European council to agree on a prolongation.\u201d The prospect of a lengthy delay has been made more palatable after the UK\u2019s advocate general in the European court of justice, Eleanor Sharpston, described claims that the European elections in May would be an \u201cinsuperable obstacle\u201d to a lengthy extension as \u201coversimplified and fallacious\u201d. The prime minister, after yet another defeat in parliament, had told MPs in the Commons on Wednesday night that a long extension would probably require the election of British MEPs in May. Sharpston said the UK could extend the mandates of its MEPs \u201cwho have already been democratically elected and who have been sitting in the current European parliament\u201d or send \u201cnominated MPs from the UK, rather than directly elected MEPs, to participate in the European parliament during that period\u201d.",

First we had a cross-party amendment seeking a second referendum, which was defeated by a huge margin \u2013 334 votes to 85 (more on why below). Then came another cross-party amendment, to impose \u201cindicative votes\u201d by MPs to determine a consensus outcome, which was defeated by two votes, 314 to 312. Slightly confusingly this was preceded by an amendment to this amendment, seeking to limit any delay to Brexit caused by the process, which also narrowly lost.</p> \n<p>Then there was a vote on a Labour amendment pushing the party\u2019s own Brexit plan, which fell by 318 votes to 302. We then had an amendment seeking to discover if, under parliamentary protocol, May can bring her Brexit plan back to the Commons again. It was pulled by its proposer, Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant.</p> \n<p>Finally, the main government motion on delaying Brexit, which was unamended, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/14/mps-vote-by-majority-of-210-to-extend-article-50-and-delay-brexit\">passed by 413 to 202</a>.</p> \n<h2>So Brexit will be delayed?</h2> \n<p>Yes \u2013 on the assumption the EU member states unanimously agree. If they do not \u2013 which seems unlikely \u2013 the UK still leaves on 29 March, but without a deal. The government motion decrees that the government will seek agreement with the EU for an extension to article 50 beyond 29 March.</p> \n<p>It says that if a Brexit plan is agreed by 20 March \u2013 it is widely assumed May will have a third try at squeezing her deal through the House of Commons early next week \u2013 then there will be a brief extension, until 30 June, allowing legislation to pass. If not, it will be for longer.</p> \n<h2>Will the UK be getting new MEPs?</h2> \n<p>If the longer extension happens then, according to the government, yes. The country would take part in the European elections 10 weeks from now. And, as we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/uk-officials-working-on-contingency-planning-for-european-elections\">have learned this week</a>, UK officials are already making contingency plans for such an eventuality.</p> \n<h2>But we won\u2019t have indicative votes?</h2> \n<p>Well, perhaps, as it happens. Yes, the cross-party motion seeking to impose this on the government next week was very narrowly defeated. But opening the debate, May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/14/government-to-allow-indicative-votes-if-there-is-long-brexit-delay\">said the government would push</a> for such a plan if May\u2019s deal falls again and there is a resulting long delay to Brexit.</p> \n<h2>Is this it for a second referendum?</h2> \n<p>It depends who you ask. Brexiters reacted to the crushing defeat of the plan by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveBakerHW/status/1106243326133653505\">cheerily tweeting</a> about its demise. But supporters of the scheme were adamant that this was an inevitable defeat for a premature attempt to force the issue. It is nonetheless a setback for them. What is \u2013 and always was \u2013 obvious is that if the plan is ever to pass in the Commons it will need the wholehearted support of the Labour leadership.</p> \n<h2>Was it a better day for Theresa May?</h2> \n<p>It was better <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/12/how-tory-eurosceptics-turned-against-mays-brexit-deal\">than Wednesday</a>, but that is, admittedly, a pretty low bar. May won the government motion (even though she did not want it) and the amendments were all seen off. But she had long promised that 29 March would be Brexit day, and it is a heavy political blow that she could not deliver this.

      "body": "<p>Brexit day is meant to be 29 March 2019. But now British MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/mps-reject-no-deal-brexit-by-majority-of-four\">rejected no deal</a><strong> </strong>and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/12/mps-ignore-mays-pleas-and-defeat-her-brexit-deal-by-149-votes\">deal on the table</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/14/mps-vote-by-majority-of-210-to-extend-article-50-and-delay-brexit\">voted for an extension</a> to the timetable to 30 June, it seems certain the talks will go into extra time.</p> <h2>How does that work?</h2> <p>Extending Brexit is a job for EU leaders, say numerous diplomatic sources. The EU\u2019s 27 heads of state and government would have to decide unanimously at an EU summit on Thursday 21 March. But first the UK has to ask. The EU cannot consider the question until the British government makes a formal request to extend article 50.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/mps-reject-no-deal-brexit-by-majority-of-four\">MPs reject no-deal Brexit by majority of 43 in second vote</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Would the EU say yes?</h2> <p>Probably. While any single country has the right to block a Brexit extension, most diplomats think the EU would agree, although this cannot be taken for granted.</p> <p>In response to Thursday\u2019s vote, the European commission stressed that the UK would not automatically be granted an extension, saying the EU would have to consider its own interests.</p> <p>The wildcard is that EU leaders have never discussed the issue and often take a stricter line than officials. In December, for example, EU leaders decided it would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/eu-rejects-irish-backstop-time-limit-but-backs-technological-solution\">pointless granting the UK further legal assurances</a> on the Irish backstop, concluding that another legal paper was unlikely to sway MPs in favour of a Brexit treaty. It turned out they were right. But blocking an extension could be seen as tantamount to forcing the UK to leave the EU without a deal. The EU does not want to go down in history with the blame for Brexit.</p> <p>And the British request matters: the UK must be able to show \u201ca <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/12/credible-justification-needed-to-delay-brexit-says-donald-tusk\">credible justification for a possible extension</a> and its duration\u201d, a spokesman for the European council president, Donald Tusk, has said.</p> <h2>What is a \u2018credible justification\u2019?</h2> <p>That\u2019s not entirely clear.

      "bodyText": "Brexit day is meant to be 29 March 2019. But now British MPs have rejected no deal and the deal on the table, and voted for an extension to the timetable to 30 June, it seems certain the talks will go into extra time. How does that work? Extending Brexit is a job for EU leaders, say numerous diplomatic sources. The EU\u2019s 27 heads of state and government would have to decide unanimously at an EU summit on Thursday 21 March. But first the UK has to ask. The EU cannot consider the question until the British government makes a formal request to extend article 50. Would the EU say yes? Probably. While any single country has the right to block a Brexit extension, most diplomats think the EU would agree, although this cannot be taken for granted. In response to Thursday\u2019s vote, the European commission stressed that the UK would not automatically be granted an extension, saying the EU would have to consider its own interests. The wildcard is that EU leaders have never discussed the issue and often take a stricter line than officials. In December, for example, EU leaders decided it would be pointless granting the UK further legal assurances on the Irish backstop, concluding that another legal paper was unlikely to sway MPs in favour of a Brexit treaty. It turned out they were right. But blocking an extension could be seen as tantamount to forcing the UK to leave the EU without a deal. The EU does not want to go down in history with the blame for Brexit. And the British request matters: the UK must be able to show \u201ca credible justification for a possible extension and its duration\u201d, a spokesman for the European council president, Donald Tusk, has said. What is a \u2018credible justification\u2019? That\u2019s not entirely clear. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has said he opposes \u201cany extension of article 50, even just for 24 hours, if it is not based on a clear majority from the House of Commons in favour of something\u201d. Some EU sources say \u201ccredible justification\u201d means time to hold a general election or a referendum. Others have no fixed view, and member states don\u2019t want to be boxed in with strict criteria. How long? A short \u201ctechnical\u201d extension of two to three months to allow parliament to pass Brexit legislation would have been easy to agree if MPs had voted for the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Now the deal has gone down in flames, the EU faces a dilemma. A short extension is seen as heightening the chances of the UK tumbling out of the EU just before European elections. But a long extension means the EU could be bogged down in Brexit for months or years, while numerous foreign and economic policy problems are jostling for attention. Many see a short extension as pointless. \u201cThe problem is that after the massive defeat of [Tuesday] it is hard to believe that we can fix the deal if she gets three more sentences on the backstop,\u201d a senior source said. Various options have been mooted, from three to 21 months, but there is no fixed view. What do EU players think? Germany does not want to rush the UK out of the door and thinks the Brexit debate would benefit from breathing space. France also wants to keep options open, despite tough talk in public from Emmanuel Macron. Some traditional allies, such as the Netherlands, have voiced impatience. Some in the EU institutions are worried about Brexit \u201cpolluting\u201d the EU\u2019s agenda for months, with no upside. Would there be strings attached? Brexiters have raised the prospect of Brussels attaching tough conditions to any Brexit extension, but the EU would be bound by its own laws. The UK would remain an EU member state with the rights and obligations that entails, including annual payments to the EU budget, upholding judgments from the European court of justice and taking part in European elections. So Nigel Farage could remain an MEP? EU officials say the UK must be represented in the European parliament if it is a member state. Officials are incredulous that the British government would be ready to countenance \u201ca blatant treaty violation of the rights of their citizens\u201d, in the words of one source. British citizens and EU citizens living in the UK could go to the European court to challenge the absence of British MEPs or laws from a parliament not representing them. So the former Ukip leader could run again in European elections \u2013 along with the UK\u2019s 72 other MEPs, who largely get far less attention. Some British politicians think there is a quick fix: for example, a treaty change that would allow the government to appoint MEPs for a limited period. But the last EU treaty amendment \u2013 a eurozone crisis amendment in 2011 \u2013 took two and a half years to be ratified by the EU\u2019s 28 parliaments.

      "bodyText": "PPS: The Institute of Directors are particularly scathing of our political leaders. Edwin Morgan, Interim Director General of the Institute of Directors, says: \u201cFew in business will be stepping forward to thank Parliament for its efforts this week. We know a tiny, tiny amount more about the next steps than we did a couple of days ago, but the problem is that the clock is still ticking and no deal is still the default. \u201cIt may be folly to hope that Parliament can agree on anything more than what it doesn\u2019t want, but the Brexit process parted company with reason a long time ago, so what choice do business leaders have?\u201d PS: Here\u2019s a bit more reaction to MPs voting to extend Article 50 tonight. Andrew Gray, Head of Brexit at PwC, says firms should keep preparing for a no-deal: \u201cSome businesses may see today\u2019s news as a reason to slow down on their preparations for the imminent threat of no-deal, but an extension is not yet a done deal.\u201d \u201cThe legal default remains that the UK leaves on 29 March, with or without a deal, and that is what businesses need to prepare for.\u201d \u201cBusinesses must not take their foot off the gas, and we urge all organisations to keep preparing for both a deal and no-deal scenario.\u201d Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, says the UK needs political leadership: \u201cSeeking an extension to Article 50 is welcome as an alternative to leaving the EU with no deal. But it will only be meaningful if the time is used to agree a realistic way ahead that can win the support of Parliament and the EU27. Political leadership is long overdue. \u201cThe urgent and overriding priority of the Government and all MPs must now be to agree a clear plan to put an end to the uncertainty over Brexit that is blighting investment decisions and development activity across the country.\u201d Food and Drink Federation CEO Ian Wright CBE welcomed the vote: \u201cTonight the House of Commons has begun to indicate its preferred way forward to break the Brexit logjam. Clarity on that has been long awaited and is welcome. However, as the focus moves away from a 29 March 2019 exit date towards a later date, we must not overlook that 29 March is still the date in the Withdrawal Act. It is critical that MPs now follow-through on their intentions with actions. The government must swiftly agree the length of delay with the EU and table a statutory instrument to change that date. Only then can the diversion of time, effort and money towards no-deal planning be halted.\u201d Maybe sterling traders are simply worn out by Brexit, or sick of the sight of it. But for whatever reason, there\u2019s no real reaction to tonight\u2019s action in parliament. In the last few minutes, MPs have voted in favour of seeking an extension to Article 50 - of course, there\u2019s no guarantee that they\u2019d get it. Plus, there\u2019s still a possibility that parliament finally approves Theresa May\u2019s deal at a Third Meaningful Vote (and let\u2019s not rule out a Fourth either....) Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, has welcomed the decision , but warned that it\u2019s not enough on its own. There remain deep, underlying problems that need resolving. \u201cEven if we avoid one catastrophic cliff edge later this month, we should be wary of another just around the corner. Government must now provide clarity on what an extension means in real terms so that a solution can be found swiftly to break the current deadlock within the required timeframe, enabling business to get the certainty it needs to thrive. \u201cThe clock is ticking. Further delays will mean households and businesses remain hostage to the crippling economic uncertainty that has already plagued them since the referendum.\u201d Helen Dickinson OBE, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, also urges MPs to agree a path forwards. \u201cTonight\u2019s vote offers a glimmer of hope, but it is now absolutely essential that MPs put aside their differences and coalesce around a positive route forward. Without definitive action by MPs in the next six days, we will see the UK crashing out of the EU on March 29th without a deal. This would inevitably lead to higher prices and less choice on the shelves for consumers. The uncertainty surrounding a no deal Brexit is already harming the UK economy. \u201cBritain stands on a knife edge. Parliament must put an end to this uncertainty.\u201d More here: Goodnight. GW Theresa May will be breathing a sigh of relief, as MPs very narrowly vote against taking control of the Brexit process by holding a series of indicative votes. Again, the pound takes the news calmly -- it\u2019s still down around 0.8 of a cent at $1.325 tonight (having hit a nine-month high yesterday). Reminder: Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the Brexit action: Over in parliament, MPs voted against holding a second referendum on Brexit by 334 votes to 85 (Labour told its MPs to abstain). The pound hasn\u2019t reacted, though... European stock markets have closer higher tonight. The FTSE 100 gained 0.4%, on hopes that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. However, Germany\u2019s DAX index lagged behind, as concerns over its economy cast a shadow. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: The FTSE extended its winning streak into a fourth session. Financials cheered the House of Commons voting to take a no deal Brexit off the table, whilst oils majors rallied on the back of stronger oil prices. The pound easing off 9-month highs, reached in the previous session, also offered support to the FTSE. The Dax was a noticeable laggard within Europe, with investors unable to shake off growing concerns over the health of the German economy. German industrial production figures earlier in the week disappointed and today, German inflation also surprised to the downside, ticking lower to 1.4%. Rather than anomalies, softer data is becoming a trend for Germany as more evidence points to slowing growth. Another example of how the rich are getting rich just landed. Sir Martin Sorrell will earn \u00a32.13m from the WPP long-term incentive plan this year, nin months after he left the company last summer amid allegations of staff bullying, which he denies. The Financial Times explains that WPP has decided not to challenge Sorrell\u2019s right to benefit from the scheme. The advertising company said that its executive performance share plan for the period between 2014 and 2018 would result in a vesting of 33.3 per cent of the maximum. Sir Martin would be entitled to around 250,000 shares under the terms of the plan and will be paid dividends on top of the value of the stock, according to WPP. During his long tenure at WPP, Sorrell regularly received large pay packets including \u00a370.4m in 2014, and \u00a313.9m in 2017. On Brexit, Britain took another baby step towards protecting itself from no-deal disruption today. The Department for International Trade announced it has signed a trade continuity deal with Papua New Guinea and Fiji. That should allow UK companies to continue trading even if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. Obviously we all share Dr Fox\u2019s delight. Except.... it looks like Britain only exported \u00a351m of goods to Papua New Guinea in 2016, and just \u00a32m to Fiji (the ONS has a handy tool here). Ursula Johnston, head of customs at City lawyers Gowling WLG, thinks the government should curb its enthusiasm, until it has something important to announce on trade. \u201cWhile gratifying to know that uninterrupted trade will continue, the fact that it is with such minor partners - with the UK\u2019s 2017 trade with Fiji amounting to 0.0001% of that, and Papa New Guinea just 0.0003% - makes it negligible to say the least. \u2018Shifting seats on the Titanic\u2019 comes to mind if this is being considered a victory in its own right \u2013 surely better to wait for these \u2018deals\u2019 to accumulate before announcing the collective result. Piecemeal agreements and insignificance are surely the last things we need now?\u201d After its best day in almost two years yesterday, sterling has dipped back today as the Brexit crisis rumbles on. Against the US dollar, the pound has lost around 0.5% to $1.328. down from $1.3340 - a nine-month high. MPs will be voting on a motion to seek an extension of Article 50 in a little over an hour\u2019s time, plus an amendment on whether to hold a second referendum (which the People\u2019s Vote campaign thinks isn\u2019t a question for today) City traders continue to worry that Britain could crash out without a deal, on 29th March. Ken Odeluga, analyst at City Group, says: Some senior EU officials are dropping barely veiled signals about a \u201clong extension\u201d. The type that could pave the way for the UK to remain within the union Such comments could deter pro-Brexit MPs from opting for a short A50 delay tonight Newsflash: As if Theresa May didn\u2019t have enough problems, Donald Trump has just weighed in - saying a second Brexit referendum would be \u2018unfair\u2019. He\u2019s speaking in the Oval Office, with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar. Trump also says he\u2019s surprised how badly Brexit is going, and that May didn\u2019t take his advice on how to handle negotiations: [It\u2019s worth remembering that a trade deal with China is still on Trump\u2019s to-do list]. Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell have given a timely example of surging wages at the top, by doubling their CEO\u2019s pay packet. Ben van Beurden\u2019s pay package more than double to \u20ac20.1m (\u00a317m) in 2018, the oil company said on Thursday. That included a \u20ac1.5m base salary, a \u00a32.5m annual bonuses, and \u20ac15m from a long-term incentive plan. Astonishing, this only van Beurden\u2019s second highest pay cheque - he picked up \u20ac24m in 2014 (due to pension changes when he joined Shell). It also means the CEO picked up 143 times as much as the median Shell employee. Shell insists that its pay ratio is consistent with other top UK listed companies, and that van Beurden deserves to be rewarded for his leadership. But Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, says it\u2019s \u201cludicrous\u201d to think that the Shell CEO wouldn\u2019t have worked as hard or effectively without these vast incentive payments. \u201cThese very large payouts are indicative of a flawed governance model and warped corporate culture that has made the UK one of the most unequal countries in western Europe. We don\u2019t think remuneration committees are anywhere near brave enough in asking questions about whether such largesse is necessary or proportionate.\u201d Back in the UK, John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has warned Britain is still working for the super-rich, but not the poor. McDonnell says today\u2019s IFS report confirms that the end of austerity is a long way away, particularly for families relying on frozen benefits. \u201cDespite a windfall from the rapidly rising earnings of the super-rich, there was no new money for schools, social care or the justice system driven into crisis by this Government, and the Chancellor still remains \u201cnot currently on course\u201d to meet his balanced budget target. \u201cThe IFS also highlighted that there is \u2018no reprieve\u2019 for those who rely on social security, with yet another year of cruel real terms cuts in benefits ahead. \u201cAusterity has failed on its own terms, as well as for the millions who are paying the price for the Conservatives\u2019 decisions to go ahead with tax cuts for the rich and corporations. \u201cThe Chancellor should stop using the continuation of austerity as a threat to try and force MPs into supporting the Government\u2019s dead Brexit deal.\u201d Oxford Economics also reckons the US economy is quite sharply this quarter, based on the latest data. Over to the US... where the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit has risen to its highest level in a month. The initial claims total jumped by 6,000 people last week, to 229,000 -- still low in historical terms, but perhaps a sign that the US economy is cooling. Here\u2019s the key chart from the Institute for Fiscal Studies today: The IFS\u2019s Paul Johnson has told reporters that CEO and bankers\u2019 pay may be returning to pre-crisis levels, explaining why the top 0.1% of earners are becoming so much wealthier. But in the public sector, pay is at a 30-year low relative to the private sector he adds, creating \u201cchallenges to recruitment\u201d, Johnson adds (as well as poverty to some families). Yesterday, Philip Hammond boasted to parliament that 3.5 million new jobs have been created since the financial crisis. But the truth is also that many working people are relying on tax credits, child benefit and housing benefit (or have moved to universal credit), because they simply don\u2019t earn enough. A reminder of Britain\u2019s historically weak pay growth since the 2008 crisis: Disappointingly, the Institute for Fiscal Studies also fears that schools will face more austerity in the years ahead: My colleague Richard Partington is tweeting from the IFS\u2019s briefing on the spring statement: The very richest in Britain are getting wealthier faster than everyone else, the IFS says: Pay of the top 0.1% has been rising considerably faster than the average over the last year or more \u2013 something which was not true for most of the period after 2010. In better news, the IFS also reckon Philip Hammond will be able to raise government spending, and claim that austerity really is over. Paul Johnson says: Assuming that Hammond is not fiercely wedded to a target of balancing the books completely by the mid 2020s \u2013 and the evidence doesn\u2019t suggest he is \u2013 then he probably would have room to find a reasonable amount of extra cash for the spending review period. Even an extra \u00a315 billion a year on top of current plans could keep borrowing within that 2% of GDP limit, and keep debt falling as a fraction of national income \u2013 albeit slowly. Extra spending of that sort would, finally, allow the Chancellor to say with rather more conviction that austerity really was coming to an end. It would mean spending rising not just overall in real terms, but even for \u201cunprotected\u201d departments, and as a fraction of national income. However, that extra spending would evaporate if Brexit turns sour(er). And either way, Britain\u2019s finances are worse than expected back in 2016. As Johnson puts it: The deficit is lower than forecast a year ago, but still higher than forecast in March 2016: \u00a332 billion higher in 2020\u201321. There is a consensus that the economy would have been about 2% bigger had the Brexit vote not occurred. In those circumstances the deficit would have been smaller still and the fiscal room for manoeuvre greater. The end of austerity could already have been rather more decisively with us. Newsflash: The Institute for Fiscal Studies has just published its own assessment of yesterday\u2019s spring statement. It too, is damning about the impact of continuing the benefits freeze for a fourth year, saying it will cost 10 million families hundreds of pounds each (a real hardship if you\u2019re already struggling to make your pay cheque stretch). IFS Director Paul Johnson says: There was no reprieve announced for the millions of working age families dependent on benefits. The fourth year of the benefit freeze is going ahead. 10 million families will have lost an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the freeze. Ignoring those only affected by the child benefit freeze, 7 million poorer families will have lost an average of \u00a3560 apiece. At the same time the benefit system is facing mounting challenges from increasing in work poverty, increasing numbers with disabilities, and a growing impact from high levels of private renting. Johnson also warns that the NHS, pensions and social care will swallow up 50% of UK public spending by 2040, unless things change: 2020 will see another change presaging further challenges. For the first time in a decade the number of people over state pension age will start to rise \u2013 by 1.2 million in six years \u2013 as rises in the female and male state pension ages pause. If total spending doesn\u2019t rise as a fraction of national income we are now perhaps only 20 years from the moment when half of all state spending goes on just health, pensions and social care. It was 30% at the turn of the century. Resolution have also calculated the impact of government\u2019s changes to income tax, council tax, universal credit, fuel duty and the benefits freeze since the 2015 election. And guess what -- it\u2019s the rich wot got the benefits. Taken together, these five policies boost 2019-20 incomes by an average of \u00a3280 for households in the top fifth of the income distribution, but reduce them by \u00a3100 those in bottom fifth If you freeze benefits and cut income tax, then you will make poor families poorer and rich families richer. After spending the night crunching the Spring Statement, the Resolution Foundation say that the overall effect of government tax and benefit policies put into place since May 2015 is expected to be strongly regressive over the next few years. Compared to policies that would otherwise have been in place in 2023-24, the poorest fifth of households are expected to be an average of \u00a31,400 a year worse off. In contrast, the richest fifth are forecast to receive an average gain of \u00a3300 a year. Here\u2019s the proof: While poor families face another year of frozen benefits, those earning more than \u00a350,000 per year are about to get a tax cut. That\u2019s because Philip Hammond raised the threshold for higher-rate income tax in last autumn\u2019s budget, starting in April. That \u2018bonanza\u2019 is worth \u00a3860 per year to a high earner on its own (although changes to national insurance will claw some of the money back). But still, as this chart shows, those high-earning people are the big winners since 2015, and will cash in again in the next financial year. Households with low-paid workers and children are set to be hit the hardest. As Resolution puts it: Given these policy impacts, it is perhaps unsurprising that we have previously projected significant increases in poverty for children and parents over the rest of this parliament, likely to record highs, and nothing in this Spring Statement has materially changed that outlook. More key charts from Resolution\u2019s assessment of the UK finances: Philip Hammond has defended his decision not to end the benefits freeze yesterday, despite the pain being suffered by low-income families. Speaking on Sky News, the chancellor points out that he only announced one immediate spending change, the \u00a3100m extra funding for police to fight knife crime. Otherwise, he\u2019s keeping the \u00a326bn of fiscal headroom (money he could borrow, and keep within fiscal rules) until a Brexit deal is agreed. The chancellor says: We have to keep the headroom intact, so long as there is the risk of a no-deal exit. Once that risk is removed, that money become available to us. \u201cI have a duty to act prudently\u201d with the public finances\u201d, says Hammond (channelling former Labour chancellor Gordon Brown). But he also blamed Brown for spending too much on welfare: Under the Gordon Brown/Tony Blair government, welfare spending in this country expanded by 65% in real terms. That simply wasn\u2019t sustainable. After the financial crisis when the public finances were in a terrible state, with a \u00a3150bn deficit in the last year of the Labour government, we had to take some very difficult decisions, and one of them was around welfare. Hammond then appears to promise that the freeze will end as scheduled in 2020 (although will he still be chancellor by then?) Once this period is completed and the benefits freeze is over, next year, we will have got welfare spending back into a sustainable position and it can then rise in line with inflation in the normal way. Resolution Foundation has more bad news -- Britain\u2019s wages won\u2019t catch up to their pre-crisis levels for another four years. The thinktank says: Weaker growth this year means that by the start of 2021, GDP per capita is set to be \u00a3840 lower than the OBR forecast before the 2016 referendum. A modest upgrade in the OBR\u2019s outlook for earnings means real pay is now set to return to pre-crisis levels in 2023. That would mean it taking another four years to bring to an end an unprecedented 16-year pay downturn. These charts show how chancellor Hammond has the ability to end more on public services and benefits.... ... but still allowed benefits to be frozen for another year, from April. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Austerity continues for Britain\u2019s poorest households, as the government refuses to use the improvements in the public finances to help those in greatest need. That\u2019s according to the Resolution Foundation, which has crunched through yesterday\u2019s UK Spring Statement to uncover the true picture of Britain\u2019s finances. It says that the decision to continue freezing working-age benefits for another year -- effectively a cut in real terms -- will cause real hardship. Resolution has calculated that: The four year freeze on working age benefits is expected to save the government \u00a34.7 billion by the end of 2019-20, including \u00a31.8 billion from the final year of the freeze to be implemented in just three weeks\u2019 time. On average, this policy will leave couples with children in the bottom fifth of the income distribution nearly \u00a3900 poorer in 2019-20 than they otherwise would have been, with the poorest single parents losing almost \u00a3700. Chancellor Philip Hammond offered the prospect of ending austerity yesterday. He\u2019s now got a \u00a326bn war chest of \u2018fiscal headroom\u2019 set aside for no-deal Brexit costs. He could have used some of it to end the benefits freeze. He didn\u2019t, despite also announcing better borrowing forecasts thanks to stronger tax receipts. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, says \u201ctough times\u201d remain in the UK: \u201cWhile all eyes are rightly on Brexit, yesterday\u2019s Spring Statement gave us an insight into where politics is heading in the years ahead. Despite grim economic forecasts, improved public finances mean the debate will shift from cuts vs investment to how much more we should spend. \u201cThe Chancellor set out the intention yesterday to bring the era of public service austerity to a close and has the fiscal headroom to make that a reality \u2013 but held off doing so until the UK\u2019s exit route from the EU becomes clear. \u201cBut tough times and hard choices are here to stay as austerity continues for low and middle income families affected by the \u00a31.8 billion benefit freeze in just three weeks\u2019 time. Even once departmental budgets begin to grow again, pressures will remain given the scale of spending reductions in recent years.\u201d Also coming up today Investors will be glued to events in parliament, as MPs debate whether to ask for an extension to Brexit. They\u2019ll vote at 5pm UK time. Westminster is still reeling from last night\u2019s chaotic scenes, which saw parliament vote to rule out a no-deal departure. The wheels came flying off the concept of cabinet collective responsibility, as Theresa May found herself facing yet another humiliating defeat. But yet....Theresa May could now bring her Withdrawal Agreement back to the House a third time (or even fourth?!), after threatening MPs with a long extension to Article 50 otherwise. Optimism that the UK will reach a deal, eventually, drove sterling to its highest level in almost two years against the euro, hitting \u20ac1.18. There\u2019s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from new US unemployment and house sales figures. The agenda 12.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 2pm GMT: US home sales data",

      "bodyText": "Labour will order its MPs to refuse to back an amendment on a second referendum, in a vote likely to see mass abstentions of MPs supporting a people\u2019s vote who fear it is too soon for a fresh poll to win a parliamentary majority. The Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, unexpectedly selected a second referendum amendment from Sarah Wollaston, the former Tory MP who recently defected to the Independent Group (TIG), and who has won support from the Liberal Democrats for her amendment. Labour sources immediately indicated, despite the party\u2019s policy to back a second referendum, that it would instead order MPs to abstain because they disagreed with the timing of the vote. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Commons: \u201cWe are supportive of the principle, but it\u2019s a question of timing.\u201d Senior Labour sources said they were highly suspicious of the motives of TIG in putting their amendment to the vote, and said they believed some were backing it in order to expose Labour tensions. Labour MPs who are opposed to a second referendum also enthusiastically backed the opportunity to hold a vote in parliament on the measure, with one MP saying it would \u201clance the boil\u201d and prove there was no support for a second referendum in parliament. Caroline Flint, a Labour MP opposed to a second referendum, said she was \u201creally delighted\u201d that Bercow had selected the amendment because she would have the opportunity to vote against it. The abstentions mean the amendment is likely to be heavily defeated. Labour MPs who are leading supporters of the People\u2019s Vote campaign said they were supportive of abstentions and said they did not back putting a second referendum to a vote in parliament before it could win majority support. One influential MP who called for People\u2019s Vote supporters to abstain on the motion was Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield, who has devised a different strategy for obtaining a referendum with fellow Labour MP Peter Kyle, by offering an amendment at the next meaningful vote to back Theresa May\u2019s deal in exchange for a referendum. \u201cOther opposition parties and groupings may have their reasons for putting down an amendment on a people\u2019s vote, but I will be abstaining today ,\u201d he said. Alastair Campbell, a leading figure in the People\u2019s Vote campaign, said it was \u201cwrong to press a people\u2019s vote amendment today when the issue is [article 50] extension\u201d. He said a second referendum was \u201ca possible solution to the current crisis, not an option within it\u201d and that there would be more opportunities ahead when other options to solve the Brexit crisis had been exhausted. More than a dozen Labour MPs likely to vote against a second referendum include Gareth Snell, Denis Skinner, Kate Hoey and John Mann, who had earlier supported an anti-second referendum amendment that Bercow chose not to select. The amendment with the best chance of passing is the backbenchers\u2019 proposal submitted by Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn and supported by his fellow Labour MP Yvette Cooper plus seven others including the Conservatives Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve. The amendment says it is designed \u201cto enable the House of Commons to find a way forward that can command majority support\u201d by effectively allowing MPs to wrest control of parliamentary time from May\u2019s government. A debate on Wednesday would allow the Commons to decide whether to hold a series of indicative votes to find which Brexit approach would command a majority in the house. It is also supported by SNP, Liberal Democrat and Plaid Cymru MPs. The amendments are two of the four the Speaker has selected for Thursday evening\u2019s vote on extending article 50. Voting is expected to start at about 5pm. TIG MP Chris Leslie, who recently left Labour, tweeted: \u201cSo now we know it. Labour frontbench won\u2019t support a people\u2019s vote. Long suspected, now confirmed.\u201d A Labour frontbench amendment, chosen by the Bercow, instructs May to seek an unspecified extension to article 50 to avoid exiting the EU on 29 March without a deal and \u201cto provide parliamentary time for this house to find a majority for a different approach.\u201d. That would imply a long extension as few believe a radically different Brexit deal to the one already negotiated by May can be agreed quickly with the EU. The fourth amendment Bercow selected came from the Labour backbencher Chris Bryant, who wants MPs to vote on whether they believe May can put an unchanged Brexit deal before the Commons to a vote. Parliamentary precedent holds that the government cannot ask MPs to vote twice on the same issue during the same session of parliament, to prevent the executive bullying the Commons by putting the same measure to a vote repeatedly.",

David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister who deputises for Theresa May and was opening the debate on the motion to extend article 50, said MPs would be given a say in forging a new plan if the government\u2019s could not be agreed. This has long been demanded by some MPs. One of the amendments to Thursday\u2019s motion, tabled by the Labour backbencher Hilary Benn, seeks to allow MPs to seize control of the process to allow this to happen. Lidington, however, urged the Commons not to choose this route, saying a longer extension would require the UK to take part in the European parliament elections in 10 weeks, and would damage faith in politics. After May\u2019s deal was voted down again on Tuesday, the government has said that if a plan can be passed before the European council summit starting on 21 March then it will seek a brief, technical extension beyond the current 29 March departure date to get the necessary legislation in place. Lidington told MPs: \u201cIf that proves, for whatever reason, not to be possible, we would be faced with the prospect of choosing only a long extension during which the house would need to face up to the choices in front of it, and the consequences of the decisions that it has taken: that the government recognises that the house will require time to consider the potential ways forward in such a scenario. \u201cI can confirm today that in such a scenario the government, having consulted the usual channels at that time, would facilitate a process in the two weeks after the March European council to allow the house to seek a majority on the way forward. \u201cBut we should be clear about the consequences if that were to happen. If we are in the world of a longer extension, for this house to come to a decision, then we will be required as a condition to hold European parliamentary elections in May. \u201cIn other words we either deliver on the result of the referendum, giving people and business across the country the certainty they are calling for and move on as a nation, or we enter into a sustained period of uncertainty during which time the government would work with this house to find a way through but which I fear would do real damage to the public\u2019s faith in politics and trust in our democracy.\u201d May\u2019s plan is expected to be put to the Commons for a third time early next week, with the hope that the DUP and Brexiter Conservative MPs from the European Research Group will finally back it when faced with the alternative of a long delay and likely cross-party process to forge a softer Brexit.",

Tonight\u2019s votes have shoved events quite some way in that direction. Here are the key developments.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Theresa May has now finally issued her MPs with an ultimatum; back her deal, or face a long delay to Brexit.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/13/brexit-mps-to-vote-on-leaving-the-eu-with-no-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5c89626ae4b0cf92e5a56846#block-5c89626ae4b0cf92e5a56846\"> 8.21pm.) </a>Until now she has sought to threaten Brexiters with the prospect of Brexit being delayed or cancelled, and pro-Europeans, and Labour, with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, in an effort to get MPs to vote for her plan. Tonight, with MPs voting against no deal, she has gone further than ever before in putting the squeeze on the ERG (European Research Group). </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>But her authority within her party is vanishing.</strong> May only agreed to offer today\u2019s debate on ruling out no deal because last month pro-European ministers threatened to resign en masse if she didn\u2019t. Tonight\u2019s events were a shambles for the Conservative parliamentary party, and May has been openly defied by ministers who abstained rather than follow the party whip. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/13/brexit-mps-to-vote-on-leaving-the-eu-with-no-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5c8968f9e4b0eff8e0fc2740#block-5c8968f9e4b0eff8e0fc2740\"> 8.49pm.)</a> This is not a normal state of affairs, and in the long run having such a weak PM is probably unsustainable.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Increasingly parliament really is taking control. </strong>May was defeated today on an amendment tabled by a Tory backbencher (Caroline Spelman) and pushed to a vote by a Labour backbencher (Yvette Cooper), although it was the PLP (parliamentary Labour party) that provided the muscle to defeat May. Tomorrow we are likely to see further votes on backbench amendments indicating that the legislature, not the executive, is taking the initiative. No 10 says it is not supporting calls for \u201cindicative votes\u201d on Brexit alternatives, but it seems they may well happen anyway in some form or another, via backbench amendments.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The threat of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March - a prospect that for the last two years May has repeatedly kept on the table - has almost certainly been removed.</strong> That does not mean tonight\u2019s votes kill off no deal for good (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/13/brexit-mps-to-vote-on-leaving-the-eu-with-no-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5c89584be4b0eff8e0fc267c#block-5c89584be4b0eff8e0fc267c\">7.29pm)</a>, but May has accepted it must not happen this month.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The notion that the Malthouse compromise offers an acceptable way forward has been comprehensively dismissed.</strong> This amendment was rejected by a majority of 210.

It is not legislation, and it is not a motion that gives a formal instruction to the government as \u201chumble address\u201d motions do.</p> <p>The government could choose to accept it, and treat it as binding, but it has not said yet that it will. And even if it did ...</p> <p>Second, it is not within the government\u2019s power to rule out no deal (in the terms of the motion) because it does not call for article 50 to be revoked, which would probably require separate legislation anyway. Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, who tabled it, intended it to signal that ministers should extend article 50 in the event of no deal being agreed. But, as Theresa May says repeatedly, that only postpones the problem.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-13T19:37:47.527Z\">at 7.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c895864e4b016d23425b490\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-13T19:23:07.140Z\">7.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MPs are now voting on the Green amendment (aka the Malthouse compromise one).</p> <p>This is what it says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At end, add \u201c; notes the steps taken by the government, the EU and its member states to minimise any disruption that may occur should the UK leave the EU without an agreed withdrawal agreement and proposes that the government should build on this work as follows:</p> <p>1.

Thereafter, in a spirit of co-operation and in order to begin discussions on the future relationship, the government should offer a further set of mutual standstill agreements with the EU and member states for an agreed period ending no later than 30 December 2021, during which period the UK would pay an agreed sum equivalent to its net EU contributions and satisfy its other public international law obligations; and</p> <p>4.

One senior source told the Guardian the decision to hold a free vote was \u201cincredible\u201d.</p> <p>Weyand, an architect of the Strasbourg assurances hammered out on Monday, said that the second historic defeat for May\u2019s deal showed that \u201ca short technical extension\u201d of talks could now be ruled out.</p> <p>But EU member states do not share this view. France and Germany are among several countries who want to see flexibility, although they share concerns about a long-drawn-out Brexit distracting the EU when it has numerous economic and foreign policy questions jostling for attention.</p> <p>The ambassadors concluded that the highly political question of extending Brexit talks could only be decided by EU leaders, who will assess the question at a summit next Thursday (21 March). Insiders expect the decision will be taken on Thursday by leaders, rather than pre-cooked in advance by their officials.</p> <p>If MPs vote for an extension on Thursday, a critical period of diplomacy will begin. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, will meet the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte on Friday, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Leo Varadkar on Tuesday.</p> <p>While various extension times have been mooted - from five weeks to 21 months - there has never been a default position. Insiders stress the decision will depend on what the UK asks for.</p> <p>But there is growing impatience with the UK - one ambassador asked why the EU had to assess complicated scenarios, when the British government could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/10/uk-can-unilaterally-stop-brexit-process-eu-court-rules\">revoke article 50</a>.</p> <p>Many EU diplomats and officials think a short extension - two to three months - would be pointless, while not lessening the distraction of Brexit. \u201cThe shorter the extension, the more likely it is going to stay on the European agenda,\u201d said one diplomat, from a country that favours a flexible approach.</p> <p>But others are talking tough, while the debate in parliament has not enhanced confidence in the British political system.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe damage is done. We know they are still putting party before country and humouring people who believe in fairies,\u201d said one source, referring to the revived Malthouse compromise. \u201cThere was a feeling \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be better to have a dose of no deal to bring some sanity to the debate?\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>But there is also wariness of no-deal Brexit and several ambassadors refused to accept a commission proposal that a second extension would be ruled out.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aebfde270a1a5a318b3f9ed467db1549f2965ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aebfde270a1a5a318b3f9ed467db1549f2965ac/172_10_863_518/500.png\" alt=\"Sabine Weyand\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sabine Weyand</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c8927b0e4b0cf92e5a56560\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-13T15:57:08.987Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is what <strong>Michael Gove </strong>said in his response to Emma Reynolds, when she asked about indicative votes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that, depending on how the house votes today, we may have an opportunity to vote on that proposition tomorrow.

But the uncertainty that I hoped we would lift last night, still hangs over us. We cannot allow that to continue.</p> <p>It is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world. </p> <p>Tonight, we have a choice: we can remove the threat of an imminent no-deal exit hanging over our economy. </p> <p>Tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to start to map out a way forward towards building a consensus across this house for a deal we can, collectively support, to exit the EU in an orderly way.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hammond referred to \u201ca deal\u201d that MPs could support, not \u201cthe deal\u201d put forward by Theresa May.

There are times during national crisis when parliamentarians rise to the occasion. But there was no sign of that in those PMQs exchanges. Jeremy Corbyn was absolutely right, of course, when he said that Theresa May\u2019s plan has been decisively rejected, but he did not get very far in challenging May to adopt Labour\u2019s plan and he sounded relatively unengaged considering the seriousness of what is at stake. Although he highlighted some of the horrors of a no-deal Brexit, if anything he probably understated the potential problems, and sounded less passionate about the extent of the mess than he does when he is talking about issues like, say, homelessness or poverty. He restated the case for Labour\u2019s Brexit, but he did not sound like someone poised to drive it through the House of Commons. Still, he had a a better case than May who, partly because of the problems with her voice, was literally pitiful. She had a carefully crafted soundbite (I may have lost my voice, but I understand the voice of the country), but it was not enough to restore her credibility. In the past, May has frequently accused Corbyn of wanting to stop Brexit (a surprise to those who have actually studied his record). But, interestingly, today she seemed to have dropped that line of attack, criticising him at one point for not restating his referendum policy yesterday and at another point highlighting his own Eurosceptic credentials.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-13T13:51:34.994Z\">at 1.51pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c88f2c5e4b0cf92e5a56215\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-13T12:12:59.124Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says Owen Paterson said during the referendum: \u201cOnly a madman would leave the single market\u201d.

Labour\u2019s plan has been rejected several times by this house. She says she may not have her own voice, but she understands the voice of the country. People want to leave the EU, end free movement, have their own trade policy, and ensure laws are made in UK courts. Corbyn used to believe in this too. Why is he now against it?</p> <p>Corbyn says May no longer has the ability to lead. It is rudderless. He says, where the PM has failed, the house needs to listen to the country.

That means you throw three safety nets around exiting without a withdrawal agreement. The first is that you continue to offer plan A, which is that if we had alternative arrangements on the Irish backstop, we would approve the withdrawal agreement. The second is that we would offer to buy the implementation period for the financial settlement in the withdrawal agreement, so they get about \u00a310bn a year and we all get a transition arrangement. And the third is that we take advantage of a wide-range of standstill agreements and arrangements ... and notify that trade preference to the WTO to exit smoothy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fellow Conservative<strong> Nick Boles </strong>dismissed the idea as \u201cbasically a no deal exit.\u201d He added the EU has made clear that it would not accept such options.

But a defeat by 149 votes, just weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU, indicates not only the last evacuation of any authority from the prime minister but a profound crisis in the project that is the only purpose of her government.

But then the road was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/12/theresa-may-brexit-concessions-charade-second-referendum-essential\">barred by Geoffrey Cox</a>.

There is a quieter tranche of MPs whose first preference is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>just be done with a minimum of trauma. Most aren\u2019t that bothered about the detail.

The Conservatives will have a free vote on no deal. May stressed that Wednesday\u2019s vote would not rule out no deal for ever \u2013 just for now. And if MPs decline to rule out no deal, she said, it will become official government policy.</p> <h2>What does this mean for Theresa May?</h2> <p>Whatever happens, it\u2019s not good news. Badly losing two Commons votes on your government\u2019s flagship policy is unprecedented for a modern prime minister, and in any other political era would herald their imminent eviction from Downing Street. There had been speculation that May could even resign if she lost again. While she has not, she is badly weakened, and the challenges will surely come. For now, MPs\u2019 focus is on seeking to shape <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, and few would probably want to immediately take on her onerous task. But \u2013 as with everything in this matter \u2013 events could move very quickly.</p> <h2>How long could Brexit be delayed?</h2> <p>That depends, not least on whether MPs support this. May is adamant that if there is a pause it should be brief and not one that would require the UK to take part in the upcoming European elections, taking place in 10 weeks\u2019 time. But any Commons motion on extending article 50 will be amendable, and parliament might take another view.</p> <h2>Could May seek a softer Brexit?</h2> <p>Seemingly not, at least not yet. After the vote her spokesman reiterated the prime minister\u2019s opposition to any Brexit deal that involves a customs union. Meanwhile the EU has indicated that it has no appetite for further talks.</p> <h2>What will Labour do next?</h2> <p>While pushing for a second referendum is still among the party\u2019s official demands, in responding to May\u2019s defeat, Jeremy Corbyn spoke mainly about again pushing Labour\u2019s Brexit plan \u2013 which involves membership of a customs union, or the idea of a general election. But again, things could change quickly, and those MPs who back a second referendum have not given up on the idea.</p> <h2>Could there be a general election?</h2> <p>That is what some Conservative backbenchers loyal to May were warning would inevitably happen if she lost the latest vote. This is likely to have been intended as an extra warning to would-be Tory rebels, one that went largely unobserved. An election could still happen, but that would involve extending article 50 for longer than the government wants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/12/what-happens-now-that-mays-brexit-deal-has-been-defeated-again\">What happens now that May's Brexit deal has been defeated again?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-13T08:46:13.713Z\">at 8.46am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c88a32fe4b0eff8e0fc1e44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martinfarrer\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-13T06:30:50.436Z\">6.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound rose slightly overnight as traders took the Commons vote as a sign that Brexit is now more likely to be delayed.

After May was defeated, the Labour leader <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> called for a general election.<strong> <br></strong></p> <p>It\u2019s going to be another big Brexit day, in another big Brexit week.

I\u2019ll be back in a few hours to launch a new Politics live blog, bringing you all of Thursday\u2019s Brexit and other political news. A reminder of what\u2019s on the agenda for Thursday: Parliament will vote on a motion that sets next Wednesday as the deadline for MPs to pass a Brexit deal. It says, if a deal is passed by then, the government will seek an extension of article 50 until 30 June. But if the deal is not passed by then, then the government will need a longer extension, requiring the UK to take part in European elections. Thanks so much for your company and your comments. See you soon. \u2018The best turd we\u2019ve got\u2019 - and other attempts to explain Brexit There have been some remarkable turns of phrase from commentators and politicians in their attempts to capture just what exactly has gone on in British politics in the last few days. The most quotable quote from an MP on Brexit in a while (forever?) came from Conservative backbencher Steve Double who said in parliament on Tuesday: This is a turd of a deal, which has now been taken away and polished, and is now a polished turd. But it might be the best turd that we\u2019ve got. This is also pretty good from Tom Peck at the Indy, who says: The House of Commons was a Benny Hill chase on acid, running through a Salvador Dali painting in a spaceship on its way to infinity. It has got us wondering about the best Brexit analogies, or attempts to explain Brexit that have come out over the months/years. Any favourites? Let me know in the comments or on Twitter. This one springs to mind: And a little more from Varadkar\u2019s speech, in which he says that Ireland needs its friends in the US \u201cmore so than ever\u201d. While others may make a different decision, we see ourselves at the heart of the common European home which we help to build. We want to maintain and enhance the transatlantic relationship and we are determined to protect the Good Friday Agreement and everything that flows from it. So whatever happens in the coming months, we are sure about our place in the world, we know where we are going, and as a country we are confident about the future. Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach of Ireland, has been in Washington DC, where he delivered a speech at a gala dinner. Gavan Reilly, the political correspondent for Virgin Media News in Ireland, was in attendance and says Varadkar received two spontaneous interruptions for applause as he says Ireland will remain a committed member of the EU and guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. UKIP in Northern Ireland has called Wednesday night \u201ca defining evening\u201d in which the \u201cgame-playing political class\u201d brazenly defied the very people who elected them. I\u2019m quite intrigued to know what they mean by the ominous use of an ellipsis at the end of the tweet. It\u2019s quite a menacing bit of punctuation. And Sarah Wollaston has reiterated the calls from the Independent Group for a People\u2019s Vote. A reminder that they are tabling an amendment calling for a \u201cpublic vote in which the people of the United Kingdom may give their consent for either leaving the European Union on terms to be determined by Parliament or retaining the United Kingdom\u2019s membership of the European Union\u201d. Photographs of the proposed amendment are being widely shared by MPs on Twitter tonight. Sarah Wollaston, MP for Totnes, formerly of the Conservative Party now of the Independent Group, has been watching Peston and is unimpressed by Angela Rayner\u2019s performance. She says both major parties have failed to deliver, which is why we are seeing, what she describes as, \u201cbroken politics\u201d. Labour MP for Walthamstow, Stella Creasy, has shared four videos explaining to her constituents what went down today. It\u2019s an interesting summary of the day\u2019s events, as well as giving a sense of how the day unfolded from the perspective of one of the players in the \u201ccomplete parliamentary madness\u201d of the day, as Creasy describes it. Creasy says she will be supporting amendments that give Britain a longer extension before it has to leave the EU, saying the country needs more time to \u201csort this out\u201d. Creasy says she was unsurprised that as Theresa May left the House today it was to shouts of \u201cresign\u201d, saying that any other prime minister who had failed to carry parliament with her, and indeed her own party with her, would not still be in Downing Street, adding that she thinking \u201cthe country will suffer as a result\u201d of May\u2019s refusal to step down. If you\u2019ve got seven minutes, the four videos are worth a watch. Also, thank you to starsmurf for this lovely comment, I can confirm that our moderators are indeed very long-suffering, as well as being brilliant, dedicated and all-round lovely people. They are also often unsung, so I\u2019m taking this opportunity to share your praise of them above the line: Thank you mods and all those updating ATL. We really need to have a crowdfunder set up for the poor long-suffering mods plus Andrew Sparrow and the others who have kept this going pretty much 24 hours a day over these last few days. We can keep them in coffee for when they\u2019re working and something stronger for when they\u2019re off duty or when it all gets too much. Cakes and other sources of sustenance could be provided too. We all win because journalists with plenty of sugar and caffeine in their systems can cope with the political chaos while the mods can deal with the trolls and Putinbots. A well-fed mod is a happy mod. And while we don\u2019t have a crowd-funding campaign for sugary and caffeinated goodness, the Guardian runs on a membership model. So if you love us, make sure you\u2019ve joined up. Hello everyone. This is Kate Lyons taking over the blog from my colleague Jedidajah Otte, which means we have come full circle on a huge day of Brexit news. I started this blog at about 5:30 on Wednesday morning and will keep it ticking over through the wee hours of Thursday morning, until there is no more news to report. I sincerely hope for your sakes that none of you have been reading the blog that entire time (if you have, please go to sleep), though I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you had been glued to it for that time, given the day that has just been and the stellar work of my colleagues in bringing the news to you. I\u2019ll be bringing you reaction from MPs, the papers and commentators. For now, here\u2019s how the last few day\u2019s Brexit happenings have been seen by the newspaper cartoonists of Australia: I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Kate Lyons, who will continue rounding up reactions. David Davis, who voted for the unsuccessful Malthouse agreement earlier, wants to \u201chelp\u201d Theresa May deliver Brexit. Sarah Newton MP, the 15th member of the government to quit over Brexit, has provided a statement: \u201cAt the last general election I was given a mandate by my constituents to deliver Brexit, with an orderly transition to a new, close and special relationship with the EU. To deliver Brexit with a deal not a no-deal Brexit. I believe the withdrawal agreement and the future political declaration deliver on that manifesto pledge and will continue to support it. Today, I resigned from the government so that I could vote for a motion that honours my commitment to my constituents, to leave the EU with a deal. Like many of my constituents, I have been inspired by the personal courage and resilience of the prime minister and will continue to support her Herculean effort to secure enough support from across the house to leave the EU with a deal.\u201d According to HuffPost UK\u2019s Paul Waugh, things could indeed be entirely up to Speaker John Bercow from here on. For now, Jacob Rees-Mogg seems unwilling to concede defeat, as the bill required to actually rule out a no-deal scenario does not exist yet. Gina Miller has predictably called for exactly this bill to be passed without much further ado. Or, as one Simon Schama puts it: As Tory Brexiters have suffered a major blow tonight, a number of pundits suggest that ERG MPs might support May\u2019s deal in a third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d next week. However, it is not certain that Speaker John Bercow will allow MV3 if the deal is submitted again without any changes, as Ian Dunt, editor of Politics.co.uk, points out: Greetings, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Andrew Sparrow and will gather some reactions to tonight\u2019s events in parliament. And what an evening it\u2019s been. No one knows how the Brexit crisis will end up being resolved, but it is escalating, and getting closer to the point where something decisive will happen. Tonight\u2019s votes have shoved events quite some way in that direction. Here are the key developments. Theresa May has now finally issued her MPs with an ultimatum; back her deal, or face a long delay to Brexit. (See 8.21pm.) Until now she has sought to threaten Brexiters with the prospect of Brexit being delayed or cancelled, and pro-Europeans, and Labour, with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, in an effort to get MPs to vote for her plan. Tonight, with MPs voting against no deal, she has gone further than ever before in putting the squeeze on the ERG (European Research Group). But her authority within her party is vanishing. May only agreed to offer today\u2019s debate on ruling out no deal because last month pro-European ministers threatened to resign en masse if she didn\u2019t. Tonight\u2019s events were a shambles for the Conservative parliamentary party, and May has been openly defied by ministers who abstained rather than follow the party whip. (See 8.49pm.) This is not a normal state of affairs, and in the long run having such a weak PM is probably unsustainable. Increasingly parliament really is taking control. May was defeated today on an amendment tabled by a Tory backbencher (Caroline Spelman) and pushed to a vote by a Labour backbencher (Yvette Cooper), although it was the PLP (parliamentary Labour party) that provided the muscle to defeat May. Tomorrow we are likely to see further votes on backbench amendments indicating that the legislature, not the executive, is taking the initiative. No 10 says it is not supporting calls for \u201cindicative votes\u201d on Brexit alternatives, but it seems they may well happen anyway in some form or another, via backbench amendments. The threat of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March - a prospect that for the last two years May has repeatedly kept on the table - has almost certainly been removed. That does not mean tonight\u2019s votes kill off no deal for good (see 7.29pm), but May has accepted it must not happen this month. The notion that the Malthouse compromise offers an acceptable way forward has been comprehensively dismissed. This amendment was rejected by a majority of 210. (See 7.35pm.) Given the enormous faith placed in Malthouse by Tory Brexiters, this was a colossal defeat for them. Here is our main story tonight. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is now taking over to cover any further reaction. The DUP are not minded to flinch, according to the Telegraph\u2019s Jack Maidment. This is from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. And here is the statement Jeremy Corbyn put out after tonight\u2019s votes. Tonight this house has once again definitely ruled out no deal. The prime minister said the choice was between her deal and no deal. In the last 24 hours parliament has decisively rejected both her deal and no deal. While an extension of article 50 is now inevitable, the responsibility for that extension lies solely and squarely at the prime minister\u2019s door. But extending article 50 without a clear objective is not a solution. parliament must now take control of the situation. In the days that follow, myself, the shadow Brexit secretary and others will have meetings with members across this House to find a compromise solution that can command support in the House. This means doing what the prime minister failed to do two years ago: search for a consensus on the way forward. Labour has set out a credible alternative plan. Honourable members across this house are coming forward with proposals, whether that\u2019s for a permanent customs union, a public vote, Norway plus or other ideas. Let us, as a House of Commons work now to find a solution - to deal with the crisis facing the country and the deep concerns that many people have for their livelihood, their lives, their future, their jobs, their communities and their factories. It\u2019s up to us, as the House of Commons, to look for and find a solution to their concerns. That is what we were elected to do. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who pushed the Spelman amendment to a vote, has issued this statement about tonight\u2019s votes. She said: The House of Commons has voted decisively tonight against the chaos of no deal. We are in this position because the prime minister has refused to consult or build consensus, and refused to allow votes on other Brexit options. That needs to be urgently sorted out now. The government should come forward with plans to hold indicative votes on different options, including a customs union, so we can get on with this. If the prime minister won\u2019t sort this out and build some consensus on the way forward then parliament will need to instead. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham. Those ERG MPs obviously don\u2019t include Steve Baker. See 9.07pm. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, has accused Theresa May of trying to blackmail MPs into supporting her deal. It issued this statement from the Tory pro-European Guto Bebb. He said: Tonight another government minister has resigned on principle rather than be part of a process designed to browbeat parliament into accepting a broken Brexit that the whole country knows fails to honour the promises of 2016 and would leave people poorer. But, within minutes of losing key votes on this issue, the government has decided to deploy a new false threat. The effort to turn a necessary and sensible extension to the Brexit deadline into a bogeyman that will scare MPs back into line is both irresponsible and unedifying. It deserves to be treated with the same contempt that greeted previous efforts to browbeat or blackmail MPs into supporting a Brexit deal that neither they nor the country want. Some of us did not always find it easy following the parliamentary proceedings tonight. According to my colleague Heather Stewart, we were in good company ... Unlike Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the ERG (see 9.07pm), Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG chair, hinted tonight that he could be persuaded to back the PM\u2019s deal. Asked if he would continue to vote against it, he replied: We will have to see if there is any change. There are discussions today in relation to what Geoffrey Cox has had to say to the DUP and, crucially, what may be put in the withdrawal and implementation bill which could have an effect on how people vote. So I\u2019m not the immovable object facing the irresistible force. Here is a mini profile of Sarah Newton, who resigned tonight from the government to vote to rule out no deal for good, from the Press Association. (See 9.04pm.) Sarah Newton\u2019s quiet rise within the Conservative ranks was dealt a fatal, self-inflicted blow, following her decision to vote against the government over Brexit. In doing so, she became the second minister from Cornwall to resign over the issue in a fortnight, after Leave-backing George Eustice (Camborne and Redruth) opted to return to the backbenches from the agriculture brief \u201cto be free to participate in the critical\u201d Brexit debate. History graduate Newton, a former director of Age Concern England, was among the 2010 intake of MPs, becoming the first person to win the newly created seat of Truro and Falmouth as boundary changes meant Cornwall increased its MPs from five to six. She has held it ever since. And in 2012, at the height of the furore surrounding the introduction of the so-called \u201cpasty tax\u201d, the Cornish MP spoke in the Commons about the cherished delicacy. Issuing a warning to then-chancellor George Osborne, she said: \u201cThere is growing concern throughout Cornwall about the possible unintended consequences of the Budget and about the undoubtedly real threat to the Cornish pasty of the pasty tax.\u201d From May 2015 to July 2016, Newton was a Government whip with departmental responsibility for Defra, and moved to the Home Office as parliamentary under-secretary of state for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability. The mother-of-three, who backed Theresa May in the Tory leadership election in 2016, was later appointed minister for disabled people, health and work, before becoming work and pensions minister in November 2017. She resigned on Wednesday evening, moments after defying the whips to vote for the cross-party amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the European Research Group, told Sky News that he would continue to vote against the PM\u2019s deal, regardless of her threat to seek a long Brexit delay. He explained: I\u2019ll say to the government now, when meaningful vote three comes back, I will see to it that we keep voting this down however many times it\u2019s brought back, whatever pressure we\u2019re put under and come what may. Please don\u2019t do it. Keep going back to the EU and say, \u2018It wont pass.\u2019 Sarah Newton resigned as minister for disabled people in the work and pensions department tonight as she voted against the Tory whip in the final vote and in favour of the the amended motion ruling out a no-deal Brexit for good. The Brexiter Mark Francois has told Sky News that collective discipline in the party has collapsed. Downing Street also said it had no plans for indicative votes on Brexit alternatives. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: We have no plans for indicative votes, I think I\u2019ve said that on a number of occasions. What you have seen in parliament in recent weeks is a series of plans being put before parliament by opposition parties and they have all been rejected. This is from David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, explaining why he was one of the 11 ministers who abstained in the final vote (see 8.49am), instead of voting against ruling out no deal for good, as Tory MPs were supposed to. Here are the key figures for how MPs voted in the three votes. The full lists are here. The Spelman amendment Tory MPs were whipped to vote against. But nine of them backed it: Guto Bebb, Ken Clarke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Sam Gyimah, Phillip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach, Caroline Spelman and Ed Vaizey.

Labour MPs were whipped to vote against. But four of them voted for.

They were: Richard Bacon (South Norfolk), Guto Bebb (Aberconwy), Nick Boles (Grantham and Stamford), Jack Brereton (Stoke-on-Trent South), Steve Brine (Winchester), Alistair Burt (North East Bedfordshire), James Cartlidge (South Suffolk), Alex Chalk (Cheltenham), Jo Churchill (Bury St Edmunds), Greg Clark (Tunbridge Wells), Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe), Stephen Crabb (Preseli Pembrokeshire), Tracey Crouch (Chatham and Aylesford), Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon), Jackie Doyle-Price (Thurrock), Mark Field (Cities of London and Westminster), Vicky Ford (Chelmsford), Kevin Foster (Torbay), Roger Gale (North Thanet), David Gauke (South West Hertfordshire), Nick Gibb (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton), Bill Grant (Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock), Justine Greening (Putney), Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield), Andrew Griffiths (Burton), Sam Gyimah (East Surrey), Luke Hall (Thornbury and Yate), Richard Harrington (Watford), Oliver Heald (North East Hertfordshire), Peter Heaton-Jones (North Devon), Simon Hoare (North Dorset), Philip Hollobone (Kettering), John Howell (Henley), Nigel Huddleston (Mid Worcestershire), Margot James (Stourbridge), Marcus Jones (Nuneaton), Phillip Lee (Bracknell), Oliver Letwin (West Dorset), David Lidington (Aylesbury), Alan Mak (Havant), Paul Masterton (East Renfrewshire), Johnny Mercer (Plymouth, Moor View), Huw Merriman (Bexhill and Battle), Anne Milton (Guildford), Damien Moore (Southport), Anne Marie Morris (Newton Abbot), David Morris (Morecambe and Lunesdale), James Morris (Halesowen and Rowley Regis), Robert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst), Andrew Percy (Brigg and Goole), Claire Perry (Devizes), Victoria Prentis (Banbury), Mark Pritchard (The Wrekin), Douglas Ross (Moray), Amber Rudd (Hastings and Rye), Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury), Chloe Smith (Norwich North), Nicholas Soames (Mid Sussex), Caroline Spelman (Meriden), Rory Stewart (Penrith and The Border), Gary Streeter (South West Devon), Kelly Tolhurst (Rochester and Strood), Edward Vaizey (Wantage), Matt Warman (Boston and Skegness), Giles Watling (Clacton), Mike Wood (Dudley South). The main motion, as amended Tory MPs were whipped to vote against. But 17 of them voted in favour. They were: Guto Bebb (Aberconwy), Richard Benyon (Newbury), Nick Boles (Grantham and Stamford), Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe), Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon), George Freeman (Mid Norfolk), Justine Greening (Putney), Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield), Sam Gyimah (East Surrey), Phillip Lee (Bracknell), Oliver Letwin (West Dorset), Paul Masterton (East Renfrewshire), Sarah Newton (Truro and Falmouth), Mark Pawsey (Rugby), Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury), Nicholas Soames (Mid Sussex), Edward Vaizey (Wantage). And the following 11 Conservatives, who are members of the government did not vote. Solicitor General Robert Buckland, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt, Business Secretary Greg Clark, Defence minister Tobias Ellwood, Justice Secretary David Gauke, Business minister Richard Harrington, Culture minister Margot James, Education minister Anne Milton, Scottish Secretary David Mundell, Business minister Claire Perry and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd. Labour MPs were whipped to vote in favour. But two of them voted against: Stephen Hepburn and Kate Hoey. The pound just briefly hit a 22-month high against the euro, over \u20ac1.18 for the first time since May 2017. It also extended its gains against the US dollar to a nine-month high of $1.3380, before dipping back. Tonight\u2019s drama in parliament has driven the pound up to a two-week high against the dollar. Sterling has just hit $1.33 for the first time since 28th February. That\u2019s a gain of over two cents, or 1.8%, as the currency enjoys its best day of 2019. As you can see, the pound\u2019s having a volatile week - rising on Monday as Theresa May headed for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, then plunging on Tuesday when attorney general Cox didn\u2019t change his legal advice on the backstop. Naeem Aslam of City firm Think Markets says traders are relieved that MPs voted not to accept no deal tonight. However.... The fact is that it is comforting to know that no deal Brexit scenario is off the table, but at the same time there is no table. This is because May\u2019s party is in more disarray and Brexit has become a laughing matter for everyone. Here is a Guardian guide to how MPs voted on the main motion (as amended) tonight. This is from my colleague Dan Sabbagh, who has been at the Downing Street briefing. Here is the text of the government motion being debated tomorrow. The division lists for tonight\u2019s three votes should be on the Commons website here (although it has been crashing). This is from Alasdair de Costa at the Institute for Government showing how cabinet ministers voted on the main motion. Here is the key passage from Theresa May\u2019s statement responding to the two defeats tonight. The motion we will table [tomorrow] will set out the fundamental choice facing this house. If the house finds a way in the coming days to support a deal, it would allow the government to seek a short limited technical extension to article 50 to provide time to pass the necessary legislation and ratify the agreement we have reached with the EU. But let me be clear, such a short technical extension is only likely to be on offer if we have a deal in place. Therefore, the house has to understand and accept that, if it is not willing to support a deal in the coming days, and as it is not willing to support leaving without a deal on 29 March, then it is suggesting that there will need to be a much longer extension to article 50. Such an extension would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European parliament elections in May 2019. I do not think that would be the right outcome. But the house needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions it has taken. John Bercow, the speaker, is reading out the motion for tomorrow. The government motion tabled for tomorrow sets next Wednesday as the deadline for MPs to pass a Brexit deal. It says, if a deal is passed by then, the government will seek an extension of article 50 until 30 June. But if the deal is not passed by then, then the government will need a longer extension, requiring the UK to take part in European elections, the motion says. Bercow stresses that the motion will be amendable. This is from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, says he agrees with May about the need for the Commons to show it is in favour of something. He says the government should hold indicative votes, as his committee proposes. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, asks the speaker to confirm that a motion of the house does not override statute law. John Bercow, the speaker, confirms that is the case. Jeremy Corbyn says May must work with MPs to find a solution to Brexit. Theresa May is speaking now. She says tonight\u2019s vote does not change the fundamental problem; if MPs want to rule out no deal, they must vote for a deal, she says. She says she has promised a vote on extending article 50. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, will soon make a business statement confirming that this will happen on Thursday. If MPs back a deal soon, the government will seek a short, technical extension of article 50. But if MPs do not vote for a deal, and do not want a no-deal Brexit, there will have to be a longer extension. And that would require the UK to take part in the European elections. May says, if MPs do not vote for a Brexit deal soon, she will have to seek a long article 50 extension, which would mean the UK having to take party in the European elections. Theresa May has lost again, but this time by a much bigger margin. MPs voted by 321 to 278 in favour of the motion ruling out a no-deal Brexit \u2013 a majority of 43. From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Anna Mikhailova. This is from the SNP\u2019s Hannah Bardell. Here are some Labour MPs on the vote. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg MPs are now voting on the main motion, as amended. But this is basically a re-run of the first vote. The result is likely to be very similar although it is possible that, because some MPs may not have expected Spelman to win first time round, they might vote differently now. The Malthouse compromise amendment has been defeated by 374 votes to 164 - a majority of 210. This is from Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt. After the vote on the Green amendment, we should get a vote on the main motion as amended - ie, potentially a combination of Spelman and Green. It is important to stress, of course, that the Spelman amendment passed a few minutes ago does not definitely rule out a no-deal Brexit. There are two reasons for that. First, it is not a binding amendment. It is not legislation, and it is not a motion that gives a formal instruction to the government as \u201chumble address\u201d motions do. The government could choose to accept it, and treat it as binding, but it has not said yet that it will. And even if it did ... Second, it is not within the government\u2019s power to rule out no deal (in the terms of the motion) because it does not call for article 50 to be revoked, which would probably require separate legislation anyway. Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, who tabled it, intended it to signal that ministers should extend article 50 in the event of no deal being agreed. But, as Theresa May says repeatedly, that only postpones the problem. MPs are now voting on the Green amendment (aka the Malthouse compromise one). This is what it says. At end, add \u201c; notes the steps taken by the government, the EU and its member states to minimise any disruption that may occur should the UK leave the EU without an agreed withdrawal agreement and proposes that the government should build on this work as follows: 1. That the government should publish the UK\u2019s day one tariff schedules immediately; 2. To allow businesses to prepare for the operation of those tariffs, that the government should seek an extension of the article 50 process to 10.59pm on 22 May 2019, at which point the UK would leave the EU; 3. Thereafter, in a spirit of co-operation and in order to begin discussions on the future relationship, the government should offer a further set of mutual standstill agreements with the EU and member states for an agreed period ending no later than 30 December 2021, during which period the UK would pay an agreed sum equivalent to its net EU contributions and satisfy its other public international law obligations; and 4. The government should unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens resident in the UK.\u201d Theresa May has been defeated by four votes, because MPs have backed the Spelman amendment ruling out a no-deal Brexit for good by 312 votes to 308. Theresa May\u2019s decision to allow Tories a free vote on the main motion, and on the Malthouse compromise one, is in line with a proposal she made when she was shadow leader of the Commons in 2003, the Hansard Society\u2019s Ruth Fox has just pointed out on the BBC. Here is Yvette Cooper on why she pushed the amendment to a vote. The Labour MP Debbie Abrahams thinks the Spelman amendment will be defeated. If that is right, it will be because Tory MPs who voted for it in January won\u2019t vote for it tonight \u2013 because they think it is more important for the government motion to be passed by a huge majority (which would be a snub to the hard Brexiters). To get that result, they have to defeat Spelman, because if Spelman were to pass, there would be no vote on the motion, which it would replace. This amendment is word-for-word the same as one passed by the Commons in January, after the first Brexit \u201cnext steps\u201d vote. It was passed by 318 votes to 310 \u2013 a majority of eight. Here is the list of 17 Tory rebels who voted for this amendment in January: Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire), Guto Bebb (Aberconwy), Nick Boles (Grantham and Stamford), Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe), Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon), Justine Greening (Putney), Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield), Sam Gyimah (East Surrey), Phillip Lee (Bracknell), Jeremy Lefroy (Stafford), Oliver Letwin (West Dorset), Mark Pawsey (Rugby), Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury), Anna Soubry (Broxtowe), Caroline Spelman (Meriden), Edward Vaizey (Wantage), and Sarah Wollaston (Totnes). And there were three Labour rebels who voted against: Stephen Hepburn (Jarrow), Kate Hoey (Vauxhall), and Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton). If the Spelman gets passed, there will be no vote on the government motion - because the amendment would replace it. This is what the Spelman amendment says. Line 1, leave out from \u201chouse\u201d to end and add \u201crejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship.\u201d John Bercow, the speaker, is putting the amendments to a vote. He says Caroline Spelman said she did not want to move her amendment, but Yvette Cooper told him that she did want to move the amendment. Cooper stands up. She starts saying, despite what Liam Fox said in his winding-up speech ... Bercow says he does not want a speech. He just wants Cooper to move the amendment, which she does. Fox says the Commons contracted out its decision-making to the people at the time of the referendum. The Commons is honour-bound to accept the result. He says the Lib Dems may not care about the views of the public, but he does. The British people have given parliament a clear instruction. It is time for us to determine who is the boss. Fox is refusing to take an intervention from Ken Clarke. Labour MPs start jeering at Fox, but Fox continues to refuse to give way. Clarke had longer to speak than he has got, he says. He says Yvette Cooper earlier said she wanted to know if the result of this vote would mean the UK would not leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement. That is the position, he says. But he says in the longer term the only way to take no deal off the table is to have a deal. Having no Brexit would be even worse, he says. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is winding up for the government. He says some of those opposed to a no-deal Brexit want to reverse Brexit. He says the government motion focuses on 29 March. At that point the UK either has to leave with a deal, or leave without a deal, or have an extension. An extension is not in the gift of the UK. All 27 EU countries would have to agree. And it is not clear what price the EU might extract for an extension. He says what Labour wants is impossible. It wants to stay in the customs union, but it also wants an independent trade policy. You can\u2019t have both, he says. He says for much of the debate he did not recognise the country being described. The UK is in control of its own future, he says. Pennycook says the way the government worded its amendment (see 3.10pm) is unsatisfactory. At worst it is ambiguous, at best it is contradictory. That is why Labour favours backing the Spelman amendment, he says. Pennycook asks why any responsible government would contemplate an entirely avoidable act of self-harm. And it would be a measure that does not have majority public support, he says. He says, by repeating the mantra \u201cNo deal is better than a bad deal\u201d, the government desensitised people to the risks involved. Pennycook says May\u2019s \u201cNo deal is better than a bad deal\u201d slogan desensitised people to the risks involved. Matthew Pennycook, the shadow Brexit minister, is winding up the debate for Labour now. He says it is hard to overstate how damaging a no-deal Brexit in just over a fortnight would be. It would be \u201cnothing short of a national disaster\u201d, he says. The government has suffered two defeats in the House of Lords on the trade bill. In the first, peers voted by 285 to 184, a majority of 101, in favour of a cross-party amendment tabled by the Labour former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain aimed at ensuring the continuation of frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic and blocking the imposition of customs arrangements or other checks and controls after Brexit day. Explaining what his amendment would do, Hain said: It does not place the government in a straight-jacket. All it requires is the very outcome we are all - leave or remain, government or opposition, London or Dublin - supposed to be signed up to. Namely the invisible open border on the island of Ireland we currently have. And in the second vote, peers voted by 254 to 187, a majority of 67, for a cross-party move to demand that a future trade deal with the EU would include measures that enable \u201call UK and EU citizens to exercise the same reciprocal rights to work, live and study for the purpose of the provision of trade in goods or services\u201d. Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told Radio 4\u2019s PM programme this evening that she was \u201cnot inclined\u201d to vote for the no-deal Brexit motion tonight. Tories have a free vote, so she does not have to. She said: I\u2019m going to vote to keep no-deal on the table. She also said she thought May\u2019s deal was still viable. She explained: I think it is still alive, I do. Ultimately, when you look at the alternatives - which are a customs union, no Brexit or no-deal - Theresa May\u2019s deal is more attractive than those other three options. I think that\u2019s the conclusion MPs will ultimately come to. Leo Varadkar, the Irish leader, has said that if the UK government did go ahead with its plan to avoid customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it would soon end up having to set up a backstop-type arrangement anyway. He explained: I don\u2019t think the UK\u2019s proposals will be workable for very long. They propose to treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland will become a back door to the European single market and I think that in a matter of months that will lead to the need for checks at Northern Ireland\u2019s ports. So those that opposed the agreement may find that something very akin to the backstop is applied by the UK government in a few weeks\u2019 time. Jack Dromey, the Labour MP who jointly tabled the no-deal amendment with Caroline Spelman, has just told Sky News that he does not intend to move the amendment. Earlier Spelman said she would not be moving it either. (See 3.43pm.) Dromey said MPs had already backed the amendment (in January \u2013 tonight\u2019s is word-for-word the same) and that what was important tonight was for MPs to vote, by a massive majority, for the government motion, ruling out a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. Asked if there would be a vote on the motion, Spelman told Sky News she did not know, because any MP who signed it could push for a vote. But, given what Dromey is saying, and what Yvette Cooper said earlier (see 5.34pm), it looks as though there won\u2019t be a vote on it. Sky\u2019s Jon Craig tells the programme that Spelman was \u201cnobbled\u201d and that, having decided to whip against the amendment, No 10 did not want a vote because some pro-European ministers would have voted in favour. Leading Eurosceptics are lobbying right-of-centre governments in the EU27 to veto any British request for an extension to article 50 to ensure the UK drops out of the EU at the end of the month without a deal, my colleague Patrick Wintour reports. His story goes on: In theory, only one country is required to wield its veto for any British request to be rejected. It is highly unlikely this lobbying will succeed as the governments in countries such as Hungary, Italy and Poland have other more important battles to fight with the EU. But the lobbying underlines the precariousness of the British position. And here it is in full. Here are two Europe correspondents on the Malthouse compromise amendment. From the Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster From the Independent\u2019s Jon Stone Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips is speaking in the debate now. She says she thinks Theresa May is \u201cterrified\u201d of the Brexiters in her party. Sir Nicholas Soames, the Conservative pro-European, intervenes. He says he has studied May, and he thinks May is \u201crespectful\u201d of the Brexiters, not frightened of them. Phillips says Soames knows May better than she does \u2013 partly because May does not speak to her, she says \u2013 but she insists that May looks like a \u201crabbit in the headlights\u201d in her dealings with the Brexiters. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper is speaking now. Heidi Allen, the Independent Group MP, asks Cooper if she will move the Spelman amendment herself in the light of the fact that Caroline Spelman won\u2019t move it. (See 5.20pm.) Cooper says she will listen to what Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, says in his winding-up speech. If it is put to a vote, she will support it, she says. But she says tonight is about ruling out a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. Damian Green, the Tory former first secretary of state, is speaking now. He has tabled what is known as the Malthouse compromise amendment. (See 3.10pm.) Referring to the most controversial part of the amendment, paragraph 3, he acknowledges that Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has said this proposal (a transition without the UK having to agree to the backstop, basically) is unacceptable. But he says if the government just did everything Barnier said, it would never get anywhere. He urges MPs to back the amendment, saying it offers a way forward. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot on the Spelman amendment. (See 5.20pm.) Spelman says she is going to withdraw her amendment. She says that that is because it is more important to have a big vote for a no-deal amendment (ie, a big majority for the government motion) than for her to carry on with an amendment already passed in January. So she will withdraw her amendment, she says. John Bercow, the Speaker, intervenes. He says she cannot withdraw it. It is being debated, and it is in the hands of the house. He says that she can choose not to move it. But other signatories to it could move it, he says. She can\u2019t withdraw her amendment, her amendment hasn\u2019t yet been moved - her amendment is frankly in the hands of the House of Commons. If [Spelman] puts forward an amendment and chooses not to move it, that\u2019s for her judgment and people will make their own assessment of that, but it\u2019s perfectly possible for other signatories to it who do stick with the wish to persist with it to do so. Bercow dismisses Tory attempt to cancel a vote on a no-deal amendment embarrassing to the government. This is awkward for Theresa May because the government motion would have been carried overwhelmingly, without the Conservative party splitting. But if the Spelman amendment is moved by one of the other signatories, as seems likely (Labour MPs Jack Dromey and Yvette Cooper are among those who have signed it), there probably will be a Tory split. Dame Caroline Spelman, the Conservative who has tabled the amendment ruling out a no-deal Brexit, is speaking now. Hopefully she will address reports that the government whips are trying to get her to pull her amendment. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Jack Maidment. Earlier John Bercow, the Speaker, said that at some point in the future he could end up having to rule on whether to allow another vote on the PM\u2019s deal - or whether to block it on the grounds that parliamentary rules say the Commons should not be asked to vote on a matter it has already considered. (See 3.43pm.) Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall points out that this could end up being explosive. He has more detail here. Stephen Gethins, the SNP\u2019s Europe spokesman, is speaking in the debate now. He says that a no-deal Brexit should have been ruled out straight after the referendum. The Scottish government brought together experts to come up with a compromise plan for Brexit, he says. But the UK government failed to do this, he says. The Green MP Caroline Lucas says going for a no-deal Brexit is the action of a rogue state. Gethins agrees. Nicky Morgan, who used to be seen as one of the most pro-European backbenchers in the Conservative party, has told Sky News that she won\u2019t vote for the Spelman amendment. (See 3.10pm.) The Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope thinks he know why. The Labour MP Emma Reynolds has said she welcomes Michael Gove\u2019s hint that the government could support MPs being given indicative votes on Brexit. (See 3.57pm.) The FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne says the Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper are planning an indicative votes amendment for tomorrow. Here is George Osborne, the Evening Standard editor and former chancellor, on Philip Hammond\u2019s call in his spring statement speech for consensus on Brexit. (See 1.36pm.) The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has written a blog about Hammond comment too. Here\u2019s an extract. The PM could compromise to get a hypothetical softer Brexit through the Commons - but days later find out that she could no longer govern. In this febrile atmosphere when the chancellor makes a call, as he has just done, for a \u201cconsensus\u201d across parliament to find a way out of this hole, he is also hinting very publicly to the prime minister that it might be time now to think about making that sacrifice. It\u2019s important to remember that Mr Hammond\u2019s preferred option all along has been to back the prime minister\u2019s deal, to try to get it through. But a mild-sounding call for compromise just now, is not necessarily politically mild at all. In the debate Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, is speaking in the debate now. He is restating his support for a Norway plus Brexit. In his speech opening the debate Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said a no-deal Brexit could lead to the re-introduction of direct rule in Northern Ireland. He was responding to Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP from North Down, who asked Gove if he agreed MPs, including the DUP, should give \u201cdue weight to the serious warning\u201d issued by the head of the Northern Ireland civil service, David Sterling, about no deal. Gove said Hermon was \u201cabsolutely 100% totally right\u201d. He said legislation issued by the Westminster government to empower Northern Ireland\u2019s civil servants to take decisions was \u201csustainable at the moment\u201d. But, he went on: It is also clear that the current situation with no executive would be very, very difficult to sustain in the uniquely challenging context of a no-deal exit. Now we, in the circumstances that the house has voted for no deal, would have to start formal engagement with the Irish government about further arrangements for providing strengthened decision-making in the event of that outcome, and that would include the very real possibility of imposing a form of direct rule. Now that is a grave step and experience shows us it\u2019s very hard to return from that step, and it\u2019d be especially difficult in the context of no deal. Starmer ends his speech by saying that he hopes the vote tonight will \u201cbury no deal so deep that it never resurfaces\u201d. Here is the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on Gove\u2019s suggestion that the government could back \u201cindicative votes\u201d on Brexit alternatives. (See 3.57pm.) Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw asks Starmer to reaffirm Labour\u2019s commitment to a public vote. Starmer says he can do so. The Labour manifesto said it would accept the referendum result. But it also said it would not accept May\u2019s red lines. Labour lost that election, he says. He says the goverment is in a \u201chopeless\u201d position. The PM\u2019s red lines, and no deal \u2013 the two things Labour rejected in its manifesto \u2013 are still on the table, he says. He says that is why a people\u2019s vote is still on the table. Anna Soubry asks if Labour will support a people\u2019s vote now. Stamer says Corbyn said two weeks ago Labour would table an amendment, or support one. That remains the position, he says. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is responding to Gove in the Brexit debate. The Tory Brexiter Mark Francois intervenes to say Gove implied the government will bring May\u2019s deal back to the Commons for a third meaningful vote. He says he is willing to bet Starmer \u00a350 that that vote will take place on Tuesday 26 March. Starmer says he does not gamble. Turning to Gove\u2019s speech, Starmer says Gove was blaming the opposition for the failure of May\u2019s deal. But the government has failed to reach out to other parties to find a plan acceptable to the Commons, he says. The EU\u2019s deputy Brexit negotiator Sabine Weyand has said MPs\u2019 decision to resurrect plans already rejected by Brussels countless times shows that parliament is \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d. Speaking at a closed-door meeting of EU ambassadors this morning, Weyand made the tart observation about the Malthouse compromise - a variant of plans rejected by Brussels numerous times. Quoting private remarks by the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, Weyand also said the decision to vote for no-deal was \u201clike the Titanic voting for the iceberg to get out of the way\u201d. Officials have voiced astonishment that Theresa May is allowing a free vote on no-deal, rather than seeking to defend the Brexit agreement painstakingly negotiated with the EU over 20 months. One senior source told the Guardian the decision to hold a free vote was \u201cincredible\u201d. Weyand, an architect of the Strasbourg assurances hammered out on Monday, said that the second historic defeat for May\u2019s deal showed that \u201ca short technical extension\u201d of talks could now be ruled out. But EU member states do not share this view. France and Germany are among several countries who want to see flexibility, although they share concerns about a long-drawn-out Brexit distracting the EU when it has numerous economic and foreign policy questions jostling for attention. The ambassadors concluded that the highly political question of extending Brexit talks could only be decided by EU leaders, who will assess the question at a summit next Thursday (21 March). Insiders expect the decision will be taken on Thursday by leaders, rather than pre-cooked in advance by their officials. If MPs vote for an extension on Thursday, a critical period of diplomacy will begin. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, will meet the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte on Friday, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Leo Varadkar on Tuesday. While various extension times have been mooted - from five weeks to 21 months - there has never been a default position. Insiders stress the decision will depend on what the UK asks for. But there is growing impatience with the UK - one ambassador asked why the EU had to assess complicated scenarios, when the British government could revoke article 50. Many EU diplomats and officials think a short extension - two to three months - would be pointless, while not lessening the distraction of Brexit. \u201cThe shorter the extension, the more likely it is going to stay on the European agenda,\u201d said one diplomat, from a country that favours a flexible approach. But others are talking tough, while the debate in parliament has not enhanced confidence in the British political system. \u201cThe damage is done. We know they are still putting party before country and humouring people who believe in fairies,\u201d said one source, referring to the revived Malthouse compromise. \u201cThere was a feeling \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be better to have a dose of no deal to bring some sanity to the debate?\u2019\u201d But there is also wariness of no-deal Brexit and several ambassadors refused to accept a commission proposal that a second extension would be ruled out. This is what Michael Gove said in his response to Emma Reynolds, when she asked about indicative votes: I think that, depending on how the house votes today, we may have an opportunity to vote on that proposition tomorrow. But one of the things that I think is important is that we, as quickly as we possibly can, find consensus. Labour\u2019s Emma Reynolds asks why the government won\u2019t agree to indicative votes, as the Brexit committee recommends. (See 2.49pm.) Gove says he thinks there could be a vote on this tomorrow. He goes on to say that, if a no-deal Brexit is rejected tonight, it will be important to \u201cfind consensus\u201d as quickly as possible. Gove suggests government may support MPs being given indicative votes on Brexit alternatives. Echoing what Philip Hammond said earlier (see 1.36pm and 2.24pm.) Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, asks if the government will revoke article 50 if the EU refuses to extend article 50. Gove says the UK cannot revoke article 50 and then trigger it again. The European court of justice has said that is not allowed, he says. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn asks why it is democratic to keep asking MPs to vote on the same idea, but undemocratic to ask the public if they want to change their mind. Gove claims the deal being voted on last night was significantly different from the one voted on in January. And he says Labour originally opposed a second referendum. Gove says May\u2019s deal got more votes last night than it did in January. He says MPs cannot dodge choices. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle rises to make a point of order. She says Gove has made it clear that the government intends to put the same motion to the Commons again and again. Is that allowed? John Bercow, the Speaker, says there are precedents for this. But he says at some point in the future he might have to rule on it. Bercow says at some point he may have to rule on whether Commons procedure allows a repeat vote on May\u2019s deal. Gove says it is now make-your-mind-up time for the Commons. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper asks Gove to confirm that, if the government motion is approved, the UK won\u2019t leave the EU on 29 March without a deal. Gove says that that is what the motion is designed to prevent. Gove says the government motion does not take no deal off the table. The only way you can do that is by passing a deal, or revoking article 50, he says. The SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald says Gove is one of the senior authors of the mess he has just described. (See 3.24pm.) Does he feel any sense of responsibility? Will he apologise? Gove says he voted for the deal last night. The SNP did not. He accuses the SNP of sectional posturing. Gove says farmers would face \u201cvery, very challenging circumstances\u201d in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He says many businesses have made the preparations necessary to be able to carry on trading with the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The government can do many things to mitigate against the impact of no deal, he says. But he says the UK cannot tell the EU what tariffs it must impose, and it cannot tell ports such as Calais what checks they should and should not impose. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, asks Gove to confirm that, if the government motion is passed, it will amend the EU Withdrawal Act to amend the date of Brexit. Gove says May has given that commitment. Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw says May promised free votes last night. So why are Tory MPs getting a free vote on Green, but not on Spelman. Gove says Labour should give its MPs a free vote too. Gove says, following the defeat of Theresa May\u2019s deal, MPs face a number of unattractive choices. All are worse than May\u2019s deal, he says. Anna Soubry, the former Tory who is now an Independent Group MP, says Gove has confirmed that the government motion does not take the no-deal option off the table. But MPs were told they would get a vote today on taking no deal off the table. She asks Gove to confirm that Tory MPs are getting a free vote on the Green amendment, but are being told to vote against the Spelman amendment. She suggests that Spelman will not push her amendment to a vote because of the government\u2019s stance. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is opening the debate. He starts with a tribute to Theresa May. Here is some commentary from political journalists. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he is calling two amendments - Caroline Spelman\u2019s and Damian Green\u2019s (the Malthouse compromise one). Here is the government motion. That this house declines to approve leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship on 29 March 2019; and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this house and the EU ratify an agreement. Here is the Spelman amendment. Line 1, leave out from \u201chouse\u201d to end and add \u201crejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship.\u201d This is word-for-word the same as the amendment passed by MPs at the end of January, by a majority of eight. And here is the Green amendment. At end, add \u201c; notes the steps taken by the government, the EU and its member states to minimise any disruption that may occur should the UK leave the EU without an agreed withdrawal agreement and proposes that the government should build on this work as follows: 1. That the government should publish the UK\u2019s day one tariff schedules immediately; 2. To allow businesses to prepare for the operation of those tariffs, that the government should seek an extension of the article 50 process to 10.59pm on 22 May 2019, at which point the UK would leave the EU; 3. Thereafter, in a spirit of co-operation and in order to begin discussions on the future relationship, the government should offer a further set of mutual standstill agreements with the EU and member states for an agreed period ending no later than 30 December 2021, during which period the UK would pay an agreed sum equivalent to its net EU contributions and satisfy its other public international law obligations; and 4. The government should unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens resident in the UK.\u201d This is what a Treasury source said about suggestions that Philip Hammond\u2019s comments at the end of his spring statement speech (see 1.36pm) implied he was not backing Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. The source said: [Hammond] has been very clear that he supports the PM\u2019s deal but he has also been saying for months that compromise is how we get through this and he is calling for compromise. The debate on a no-deal Brexit will start soon, after a 10-minute rule bill. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem spokesman, starts with a point of order. He says some MPs may have business interests that would benefit from a no-deal Brexit leading to a fall in the pound. Should they have to declare this? John Bercow, the Speaker, says MPs have to declare their interests in the register. The Commons Brexit committee has released a short, emergency report following last night\u2019s vote, renewing its call for indicative votes in the Commons on future Brexit options. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, said: After another historic defeat for the prime minister, the UK will now have to apply for an extension to article 50. The extension will need to be of sufficient length to allow parliament to reach agreement on a proposal that it is prepared to support. The clock has now been run down to the point where there is no alternative left given that leaving with no deal cannot be the policy of any responsible government. Parliament must now be given the chance to hold a series of indicative votes as quickly as possible or else we will not find out what there might be support for as an alternative to the prime minister\u2019s deal which has now been rejected twice by large majorities. This is from Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov, with a line from the Number 10 briefing. This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. (Presumably these would be the same Brexiters who make the point that Commons motions are not binding, eg, Jacob Rees-Mogg at 8.56am.) UPDATE: And this is from the FT\u2019s Laura Hughes. Figures released by the National Records of Scotland today, showing that the birth rate across the country has fallen to its lowest level since civil registration began in 1855, sharpen concerns about the impact of Brexit on the country\u2019s significant demographic challenges. The predictions are pretty stark \u2013 all of Scotland\u2019s population growth over the next 25 years is projected to come from migration. But a recent report from an independent expert panel warned that changes set out in the Westminster government\u2019s white paper could reduce net migration to Scotland by 50% over the coming two decades. The report also found that if the UK government ends free movement Scotland\u2019s working-age population could decline by up to 5%, noting that 63% of workers in Scotland earn less than the proposed \u00a330,000 post-Brexit salary threshold for skilled immigrants, with sectors sicj as textiles, social care, leisure and travel worst affected. It\u2019s hard to overstate how concerned businesses are about post-Brexit staffing, especially in the care and tourism sectors and those based in the Highlands. Meanwhile, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has today announced \u00a32m for Brexit support grants, previously only open to exporters, to help small and medium-sized businesses prepare for leaving the EU. The Daily Mail\u2019s political editor, Jason Groves, thinks that Philip Hammond\u2019s comment at the end of his spring statement speech (see 1.36pm), combined with what Stephen Barclay has been saying today, suggests the government is moving towards \u201cindicative votes\u201d - allowing the Commons to vote on a series of Brexit options. Rupert Harrison, who worked as George Osborne\u2019s chief of staff when Osborne was chancellor, says he thought that was implied in what Theresa May said last night, after her deal was defeated. For the record, this is what May said last night. But let me be clear. Voting against leaving without a deal and for an extension does not solve the problems we face. The EU will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension. This house will have to answer that question. Does it wish to revoke article 50? Does it want to hold a second referendum? Or does it want to leave with a deal but not this deal? These are unenviable choices, but thanks to the decision the house has made this evening they must now be faced. This is from Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, commenting on an Instagram post from Donald Tusk, the European council president. Theresa May was due to open the Brexit debate today, but Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is going to do it instead. Given the state of her voice, that\u2019s understandable. At the end of his spring statement speech Philip Hammond, the chancellor, urged MPs to build a \u201cconsensus\u201d around Brexit. He said: Last night\u2019s events mean we are not where I hoped we would be today. Our economy is fundamentally robust. But the uncertainty that I hoped we would lift last night, still hangs over us. We cannot allow that to continue. It is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world. Tonight, we have a choice: we can remove the threat of an imminent no-deal exit hanging over our economy. Tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to start to map out a way forward towards building a consensus across this house for a deal we can, collectively support, to exit the EU in an orderly way. Hammond referred to \u201ca deal\u201d that MPs could support, not \u201cthe deal\u201d put forward by Theresa May. It was a very strong hint that he would like the government to pivot towards a softer Brexit, which would potentially involve a Norway-style Brexit passing with Labour support. Hammond has also managed a Brexit joke. Announcing money for a new super-computer at Edinburgh University, which will be five times faster than the existing one, he says that, with the right algorithms, it might even be able to come up with a solution to the Northern Irish backstop. Here is some Twitter comment on Philip Hammond\u2019s no-deal warnings. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the Guardian\u2019s Richard Partington From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby In his spring statement Philip Hammond, the chancellor, says that if there is a Brexit deal, he will launch a three-year spending review before the summer. But he says a no-deal Brexit would deliver \u201ca significant short- to medium-term reduction in the productive capacity of the the British economy\u201d. He says it would lead to lower growth, higher unemployment and higher prices. During PMQs Theresa May accused Jeremy Corbyn of not referring to Labour\u2019s second referendum commitment in the Commons yesterday. Labour\u2019s Dawn Butler has accused her of lying, because Corbyn did refer to the policy in his main speech. But, as HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh points out, May seemed to be referring to the fact that Corbyn did not mention a public vote in his statement to MPs after May\u2019s deal was defeated. The Brexit debate is due to start at around 3.30pm. Theresa May will be opening it. It will run until 7pm, when MPs will vote. There are six amendments on the order paper (pdf). And two more manuscript amendments have been tabled. PMQs is now over. And Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is about to deliver his spring statement. I will cover any Brexit-related news from the statement, but our main coverage of the statement will be on my colleague Graeme Wearden\u2019s business live blog. The Tory MP Alberto Costa says the media call his place a failing parliament. But there was nothing failing when it passed his amendment on the rights of British citizens in the EU three weeks ago. What has May done to get EU leaders to agree to this? May says she has spoken to a number of EU leaders about this. Mark Pawsey, a Conservative, asks about Rugby council\u2019s housebuilding programme. May says she is please to hear it is providing more homes. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says on 29 January the Commons, and most Tory MPs, voted for the Brady amendment (saying the backstop should be replaced). Brady was designed to facilitate the Malthouse compromise. If the Malthouse compromise amendment is called later, will Tories get a free vote, and how will May herself vote? May says she addressed this earlier. (See 12.33pm.) She says her agreement with the EU says alternative arrangements for the backstop should be worked up. That is what Malthouse was asking for, she says. The Tory MP David Tredinnick asks May if Labour should allow a free vote on no deal tonight. May says it would be better if all MPs had a free vote. The Tory MP Peter Bone asked May about the Malthouse compromise amendment. In her response, May said the government had already accepted two of its four demands (1 and 4 - see 11.22am for the full text) and that MPs were getting a vote on an article 50 extension. But on the key demand (number 3), she said it was unacceptable to the EU. PMQs - Snap verdict: Profoundly uninspiring. There are times during national crisis when parliamentarians rise to the occasion. But there was no sign of that in those PMQs exchanges. Jeremy Corbyn was absolutely right, of course, when he said that Theresa May\u2019s plan has been decisively rejected, but he did not get very far in challenging May to adopt Labour\u2019s plan and he sounded relatively unengaged considering the seriousness of what is at stake. Although he highlighted some of the horrors of a no-deal Brexit, if anything he probably understated the potential problems, and sounded less passionate about the extent of the mess than he does when he is talking about issues like, say, homelessness or poverty. He restated the case for Labour\u2019s Brexit, but he did not sound like someone poised to drive it through the House of Commons. Still, he had a a better case than May who, partly because of the problems with her voice, was literally pitiful. She had a carefully crafted soundbite (I may have lost my voice, but I understand the voice of the country), but it was not enough to restore her credibility. In the past, May has frequently accused Corbyn of wanting to stop Brexit (a surprise to those who have actually studied his record). But, interestingly, today she seemed to have dropped that line of attack, criticising him at one point for not restating his referendum policy yesterday and at another point highlighting his own Eurosceptic credentials. Corbyn says Owen Paterson said during the referendum: \u201cOnly a madman would leave the single market\u201d. With May\u2019s deal decisively rejected, what is May now for? Labour\u2019s plan is the only credible show in town. May says Corbyn says he opposes no deal, but he votes to bring it closer. Labour\u2019s plan has been rejected several times by this house. She says she may not have her own voice, but she understands the voice of the country. People want to leave the EU, end free movement, have their own trade policy, and ensure laws are made in UK courts. Corbyn used to believe in this too. Why is he now against it? Corbyn says May no longer has the ability to lead. It is rudderless. He says, where the PM has failed, the house needs to listen to the country. He says British citizens face uncertainty. May needs to show leadership. So what is her plan? May says MPs will vote on no deal today, and then on extending article 50 tomorrow if no deal is rejected. MPs have to make choices. She says Corbyn does not agree with government policy, or even Labour policy. He has nothing to offer this country. Corbyn says the CBI have described a no-deal Brexit as as sledgehammer to the economy. Manufacturing is now in recession. May\u2019s deal has been decisively rejected. When will May accept that there must be a negotiated customs union with the EU. May says the CBI says Labour\u2019s policies would lead to a drop in living standards. Corbyn claims to be in favour of a second referendum. But he did not even refer to that last night. Corbyn says May\u2019s answer will not reassure people worried about their jobs. Food producers are also in despair. Will she now back close alignment to the single market to back their industry? May says her deal does include access to the EU on the basis of no tariffs. It would help if Corbyn had read it. Jeremy Corbyn also sends his condolences to those affected by the crash in Ethiopia. He says May says the only choice is between her deal and no deal. Last night her deal was finished off. And she will not whip her MPs on no deal. How will she vote? May says she will vote for the government motion. May confirms she will vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. Corbyn asks why May is still ambivalent about a no-deal outcome. May says she wants a deal. Businesses want that too. One thing they worry about more than no deal is a Corbyn government. John Baron, a Tory Brexiter, says the UK trades with countries outside the EU profitably on WTO terms. Does May accept that a no-deal Brexit is the default position, and better than a bad deal. May says she wants to leave with a good deal. Theresa May get a loud cheer when she stands up. But her voice does not seem to have improved since yesterday. She sends her condolences to those killed in the crash in Ethiopia. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. And Lord Mandelson, the former Labour trade secretary and former European commissioner, has also criticised the no-deal tariff plan announced by the government this morning. In a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, he said suspending customs checks in Ireland would be a serious mistake. He said: Refusing to comply with our responsibilities under international trade law to operate a customs border at any frontier is not a serious or sustainable solution to the problem of a hard border that Brexit - of any variety - threatens. Today\u2019s ill thought-out proposals on tariffs and customs illustrate the political, economic and reputational risk that the government\u2019s make-it-up-as-we-go-along approach poses to the United Kingdom. Today the Commons must reject any prospect of a no-deal Brexit and on Thursday they should make sure any extension of the article 50 deadline is used to deliver the clarity about Brexit that has been missing from the last two-and-a-half years of debate. Ireland \u2019s agriculture minister has said the UK\u2019s decision to impose high tariffs on beef and cheddar in a no-deal scenario are \u201cpotentially a disaster\u201d for Irish farmers. Michael Creed also said that the logic of introducing a different regime for Northern Ireland defied Brexiter logic and accused the UK of being \u201cselective\u201d about tariffs to put pressure on the Irish to buckle over the backstop. He told RTE radio\u2019s Today with Sean O\u2019Rourke show: It is interesting in the context of what is published today the UK contemplating bespoke arrangements for Northern Ireland, if we had the bespoke arrangements that are in the withdrawal agreement we would avoid a hard border. He said the department of agriculture had modelled the impact of a full World Trade Organisation schedule would have add \u20ac1.7bn to the costs of products. Ireland is the fifth largest beef exporter in the world with a trade with 50% of the meat going to the UK, a market worth \u20ac2.5 billion (\u00a32.15bn) Angus Woods, the Irish Farmers Association, national livestock chair told RTE. The idea that Irish farmers and businesses would be able to pay a tariff and compete with the likes of South American goods into the UK market just wouldn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t take a whole lot, targeting 50 or 60 container loads of the high value steak cuts into the UK market would be enough to drag the whole marketplace down and make it unviable for Irish farmers in the UK market. This is what the Malthouse compromise amendment says. At end, add \u201c; notes the steps taken by the government, the EU and its member states to minimise any disruption that may occur should the UK leave the EU without an agreed withdrawal agreement and proposes that the government should build on this work as follows: 1. That the government should publish the UK\u2019s day one tariff schedules immediately; 2. To allow businesses to prepare for the operation of those tariffs, that the government should seek an extension of the article 50 process to 10.59pm on 22 May 2019, at which point the UK would leave the EU; 3. Thereafter, in a spirit of co-operation and in order to begin discussions on the future relationship, the government should offer a further set of mutual standstill agreements with the EU and member states for an agreed period ending no later than 30 December 2021, during which period the UK would pay an agreed sum equivalent to its net EU contributions and satisfy its other public international law obligations; and 4. The government should unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens resident in the UK.\u201d. Hardcore Brexitologists will know that the amendment is actually based on the Malthouse compromise plan B. For more on Malthouse, you can read the full text here. You can read all the amendments today\u2019s motion on the order paper here (pdf). (Or at least all the ones tabled last night - John Bercow, the speaker, said yesterday he would also accept manuscript ones tabled this morning.) Conservative MPs will get a free vote on the Malthouse compromise amendment, Downing Street has decided. (See 8.55am, 9.11am and 10.32am.) This is from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. Here is Stewart Jackson, the former Tory MP who was chief of staff to David Davis when he was Brexit secretary, on the Malthouse compromise amendment (see 8.55am, 9.11am and 10.32am.) Turning back to the government\u2019s announcement about what tariffs would apply in the event of a no-deal Brexit, David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, has written a good blog with a preliminary analysis here. Here\u2019s an extract from his summary. A serious attempt to balance the different interests at play, UK producers and consumers, developing countries, and future trade agreements ... The hit to UK producers will primarily come from their inability to export tariff free, which will significantly affect competitiveness, though in some cases increased tariff free imports will also affect this; Probably little effect on consumer prices overall, these are in any case downward-sticky when tariffs are reduced (quality at the same price tends to rise though), but cars likely to be a big exception, where prices will rise, and bikes may be an exception in the opposite direction. And here is the Times\u2019s Sam Coates on what happened at this morning\u2019s cabinet. The Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford says Theresa May has been told she will face government resignations unless she gives Tory MPs a free vote on the Malthouse compromise amendment - the one favoured by Brexiters (see 8.55am and 9.11am.) Last night Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said it was a \u201cdangerous illusion\u201d to think that the Malthouse compromise plan was on offer from the EU. In his LBC phone-in Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, said Theresa May\u2019s decision to give MPs a free vote on a no-deal Brexit tonight was \u201cabsurd\u201d. He said: I think this is a fundamental matter of government policy, whether or not you are going to disable your negotiators by saying you are willing to walk away from the table or not. If you are not able to walk away from a negotiation, what is your negotiating leverage? And, on a non-Brexit matter, as the Daily Mirror\u2019s Mikey Smith reports, Johnson triggered fury by saying that police spending on child sexual abuse investigations was \u201cspaffed up a wall\u201d. In his speech to the European parliament Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, also said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit had never been higher. He said: We are at a critical point. The risk of no-deal has never been higher. That is the risk of an exit - even by accident - by the UK from the EU in a disorderly fashion. I urge you please not to under-estimate the risk or its consequences. Earlier in the European parliament\u2019s debate Melania-Gabriela Ciot - Europe minister of Romania, which currently holds the European council\u2019s presidency - said EU leaders wluld expect a \u201ccredible justification\u201d for any extension requested by the UK and for its duration. She said: The UK government and the British parliament have to come out with a clear sense of direction as to where there is a majority and timing as to when it will materialise. In the meantime, the only certainty we have is an increased uncertainty for citizens and for businesses with an already clear economic impact in terms of level of activity, investment and - more importantly - jobs. Nigel Farage, the former UKip leader and chair of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in the parliament, is speaking now. He says he warned Michel Barnier that the withdrawal agreement would not get through the Commons. The EU is now short of \u00a339bn, he says. He says opinion in the UK is hardening against the EU. He says the UK does not want four more years of trade talks. And the EU does not want them either. He says the solution is for EU leaders to veto an article 50 extension at their summit next week. Then the two sides would be able to get on with their lives, he says. Farage urges EU leaders to rule out extending article 50. This is what Guy Verhofstadt said in the European parliament about extending article 50. I don\u2019t want a long extension. I say that very openly. An extension, where we go beyond the European elections, and the European elections will be hijacked by the Brexiters, and by the whole Brexit issues. We will talk only about that, and not about the real problems, and the real reforms we need in the European Union. The only thing we will do, we will give a new mandate to Mr Farage. That\u2019s exactly wants. Why he wants that? For two reasons. First of all, he can continue to have a salary that he can transfer to his offshore company. And the second thing is that he can continue to do his dirty work in the European Union, that is to try to destroy the European Union from within ... What we need is now certainty from the House of Commons ... And so I am against every extension, whether an extension of one day, one week, even 24 hours, if it is not based on a clear opinion of the House of Commons for something, that we know what they want. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European parliament, and the parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, is speaking now. He starts by telling Henkel (see 9.45am) that Henkel needs to address his remarks to his Conservative party colleagues in the European Conservatives and Reformists group. He says a long extension of article 50 would mean Nigel Farage staying on as an MEP. He would continue to get his salary, which he could pay into his offshore company, and he would continue to be able to do his \u201cdirty work\u201d in the EU. Verhofstadt says he would be opposed to any article 50 extension unless the UK has decided what it wants. Hans-Olaf Henkel, the German MEP who is vice chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists in the European parliament, says the best solution would be for the UK to stay in the EU. He says the commission should help those in the UK who are campaigning for a second referendum. And it should offer reform on immigration rules. That would make a difference, he says. He says the EU will never be complete without the UK. Manfred Weber, the leader of the centre-right European People\u2019s party in the European parliament, and its candidate to be the next European commission president, is speaking now. He says Brexit has let down a whole generation of young Europeans. And he repeats the point Barnier made; the EU can only grant an article 50 extension if it knows what the UK wants. He says \u201cthe Brits\u201d must clarify this at the next EU summit. Brexit was made by populism, by easy answers. But the Brexiters cannot provide any easy answers now, he says. Barnier is now speaking in English. People ask if he is disappointed after last night\u2019s vote, he says. But he says his answer is always the same. The EU remains respectful of the UK, and it will remain calm and united in these negotiations, defending the EU and its citizens. And that is it. Barnier has now finished. Barnier says there can be no further assurances to the UK. What will happen now? Barnier says there will be votes in the Commons on no deal, and on extending article 50. He says he hopes the UK will eventually agree on a constructive proposal. The EU needs an answer now, he says. He says the UK has to explain why an extension should be granted. He says the EU cannot grant an extension until it gets an answer. They have to tell us what it is they want for their future relationship. What will their choice be, what will be the line they will take? That is the question we need a clear answer to now. That is the question that has to be answered before a decision on a possible further extension. Why would we extend these discussions? The discussion on article 50 is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement. It is there. That is the question asked and we are waiting for an answer to that. Barnier says the EU cannot grant an article 50 extension until it knows why the UK wants one. Barnier says the EU is not being inflexible in relation to the Irish backstop out of dogma. It is a matter of practicalities, he says. It is about protecting the single market. Barnier says the next stage of the Brexit negotiation, the one dealing with the future trade relationship, will be more important than the current one. He says if the UK wants an orderly Brexit, then the treaty already agreed is the only available one. In the European parliament Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking now. There is a live feed here. Barnier says last night\u2019s Commons vote just prolongs and makes worst the deep uncertainty about Brexit. Responsibility for the Brexit decision belongs solely with the UK, he says. This is from the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. Boris Johnson tells LBC that MPs will be debating the \u201cvery good\u201d Malthouse compromise amendment last night. Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, is holding an LBC phone-in. Nick Ferrari, the presenter, reads out a quote from Johnson saying it would be easy to negotiate new trade deals. Johnson says he does not regret this. But only a handful of deals, to rollover the benefits of exiting EU trade deals, have been agreed, Ferrari says. Johnson claims there is still time to get a better deal from the EU. He says the EU always agrees deals at the last moment. Or the horses change in the final furlong, as he puts it. I covered a lot of EU summits, I have been to a lot of them in my time, I have seen how the EU works. The horses always change places in the final furlong, it\u2019s always at five minutes to midnight that the real deal is done. In Brussels the real fix is always in at the end. Rees-Mogg says the most likely thing now is the UK leaving on 29 March without a deal. But he says people who want to delay Brexit, like Yvette Cooper and Dominic Grieve, want to stop it entirely. And that\u2019s it. His LBC interview is over. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, picking up from Matthew Weaver. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Reseach Group, the powerful caucus representing up to 80 or so Conservatives pushing for a harder Brexit, is on LBC now. Q: Some people are saying Britain has lost its Brexit. Is that right? Rees-Mogg says he does not accept that. If he did, he would not have voted against the deal last night. He says parliament has already voted to leave the EU. What MPs voted for last night was opinion, he says. The article 50 legislation and the EU Withdrawal Act were law. They are in a different category. Q: So if MPs vote for an extension, it will not necessarily happen? That\u2019s right, says Rees-Mogg. He says it is up to the EU to offer an extension. Q: What do you expect to happen now? Rees-Mogg says he expects the motion ruling out no deal to go through. But it does not really change anything, because it is not law. Rees-Mogg says voting to rule out no deal won\u2019t have legal force. Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the European Research Group, claimed Brexiters were \u201call really yearning to be able to vote for\u201d Theresa May\u2019s deal last night. But he claimed attorney general Geoffrey Cox\u2019s verdict that the risk of staying in the backstop remained unchanged meant they had to reject it. He told Today: That final paragraph of his advice showing we would not have a lawful mechanism to exit the backstop, really blew up all prospect of us being able to vote for the deal. Asked what should happen now, Baker said: We have tabled an amendment related to the Malthouse B compromise. That means you throw three safety nets around exiting without a withdrawal agreement. The first is that you continue to offer plan A, which is that if we had alternative arrangements on the Irish backstop, we would approve the withdrawal agreement. The second is that we would offer to buy the implementation period for the financial settlement in the withdrawal agreement, so they get about \u00a310bn a year and we all get a transition arrangement. And the third is that we take advantage of a wide-range of standstill agreements and arrangements ... and notify that trade preference to the WTO to exit smoothy. Fellow Conservative Nick Boles dismissed the idea as \u201cbasically a no deal exit.\u201d He added the EU has made clear that it would not accept such options. He said: It is incredibly important for all of us to stick to things that actually can be deliver and not to try to come up with new schemes that which simply won\u2019t fly. Boles said parliament should use any extension to article 50 to \u201cstart voting on compromises\u201d. He added: We have not been given the chance ever, by this prime minister, to debate and vote on alternative compromises. We need to start doing that next week so the EU sees that we are actually making progress, that we are gripping reality not fantasy. Boles said the prime minister was entitled to try to get her deal through. But he added: What she is not entitled to do is prevent the rest of us from seeing if there are alternatives compromises that could attract the support of a majority. David Cameron has urged his successor to abandon her deal and search of \u201cother alternatives\u201d on Brexit. Speaking to reporters outside his house, he said: Obviously what needs to happen next is to rule out no deal, that would be a disaster for our country and to seek an extension and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen next. What happened last night is that some people who have always wanted Brexit have voted against it again. And this is exasperating for the prime minister and I think she should feel free to look at other alternatives for partnership deals, and the like, in order to solve this problem, because you can\u2019t go on with a situation where people who want Brexit keep voting against it. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has called for parliament to reach a consensus deal on leaving the EU. Speaking to the Today programme she called on the prime minister to give MPs a free vote on all of the options out of the current impasse. She said: There are very very common areas between Labour\u2019s position and the position that has been set out by a number of Tory MPs ... to having a customs union deal and a strong single market deal. She also appeared to play down the option of a second referendum. Long-Bailey said: We haven\u2019t ruled out a people\u2019s vote, but our priority is securing a deal, but we also stated that we would keep all options on the table to avoid a damaging Tory Brexit and a no-deal Brexit. She added: We need to move the prime minister\u2019s red lines towards a deal that would secure a parliamentary majority. First we need to rule out no deal. Secondly we need to look at the extension of article 50 for a short period of time in order to give us the opportunity to renegotiate a deal. I\u2019m sure that there will be a number of amendments put forward in the next few days outlining the direction of travel that parliament should take, because it is clear that the prime minister is not capable at this time of trying to find that consensus. Asked about another vote of no confidence in the government, Long-Bailey said: Of course it is something that we may consider in the future, but our priority at the moment is looking at ruling out no deal, making sure that we get that extension and we use it wisely to renegotiate the deal going forward. Tariffs will be slashed to zero on 87% of imports to the UK as part of a temporary no-deal plan to prevent a \u00a39bn price shock to business and consumers, the government has announced today. But tariffs will apply to certain goods including beef, lamb, pork, poultry and some dairy products to \u201csupport farmers and producers who have historically been protected through high EU tariffs\u201d. MPs will be voting later on Wednesday to reject a no-deal Brexit after a humiliating 149-vote defeat for Theresa May\u2019s deal in the Commons on Tuesday. The government described today\u2019s announcement as a \u201cmodest liberalisation\u201d of tariffs designed to minimise disruption to business and price shock in the supermarkets. Responding to the tariff regime, CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told Today: This tells us everything that is wrong with a no-deal scenario. What we are hearing is the biggest change in terms of trade this country has faced since the mid-19th century being imposed on this country with no consultation with business, no time to prepare. This is no way to run a country. What we potentially are going to see is this imposition of new terms of trade at the same time as business is blocked out of its closest trading partner. This is a sledgehammer for our economy. On the new tariff regime, Barclay told Today it was a \u201cmodest liberalisation\u201d of trade. \u201cThis is a modest liberalisation, it is a temporary measure, this is for a short term while we engage with business and see what the real-term consequences are,\u201d he said. The Guardian\u2019s Lisa O\u2019Carroll tweets the details of the new tariffs: Steve Barclay (or \u2018Steve Brexit\u2019 as John Humphrys called him) is still promoting Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement despite the two crushing Commons defeats. \u201cThe best way of getting Brexit delivered was the vote put before the House last night,\u201d the Brexit secretary said. Citing a point made by Ken Clarke, Barclay added: \u201cWhatever deal you have you have to have the withdrawal agreement. The EU has been clear on that. And there is nothing in the withdrawal agreement that the Labour party in principle disagrees with.\u201d His comments suggest the government has not ruled out a third vote on the withdrawal agreement. Alun Cairns, the Wales secretary, is making similar hints according to Sky News. Angela Merkel has said that securing EU leaders\u2019 agreement on a Brexit delay up until the end of June will be \u201ceasy\u201d, according to senior diplomatic sources. Attitudes in some of the EU\u2019s capitals towards a possible extension of article 50 have recently hardened, with diplomats complaining that London had been \u201clazy\u201d and taken a positive decision for granted. But the German chancellor let it be known at the recent EU-Arab summit in Sharm el-Sheikh that Berlin will not stand in the way, sources have disclosed to the Guardian. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has been put up to face the media today. He is asked on the Today programme how he\u2019ll vote in the no deal vote. He dodges and says he\u2019ll wait to see what the amendments are. But faced with a choice between no deal and no Brexit, Barclay says he\u2019d favour no deal. Stephen Barclay says he would prefer no deal to no Brexit. Britain will slash tariffs on a range of imports from outside the European Union if MPs vote to leave without a deal, PA reports. But some products coming from the remaining 27 EU member states which are currently imported free of tariffs will now face levies for the first time. Ministers said that, overall, the changes would represent a \u201cmodest liberalisation\u201d of the UK\u2019s tariff regime. Under a unilateral temporary scheme announced by the government, 87% of all imports to the UK by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access - up from 80% at present - while many other goods will be subject to a lower rate than currently applied under EU rules. In special arrangements for Northern Ireland, the UK\u2019s temporary import tariffs will not apply to EU goods crossing the border from the Republic. Here is the Guardian\u2019s Rafael Behr on last night\u2019s defeat. And this is how his column starts. There might still be ways that Brexit can go badly; unexplored dead ends and byways of failure. But the road to success is now closed. Parliament\u2019s second verdict on Theresa May\u2019s deal is slightly less crushing than the first one in January. But a defeat by 149 votes, just weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU, indicates not only the last evacuation of any authority from the prime minister but a profound crisis in the project that is the only purpose of her government. She had one job, and she cannot do it. Vital questions about the future will now be settled in a state between despondency and panic. There is no strategy, no guiding intelligence. A plan must be salvaged from the wreckage of a bad idea badly executed. There was a moment, early today, when May thought she saw a way through. A path was briefly visible to the promised land of orderly Brexit. The prime minister had brought legal clarifications from Strasbourg to embellish her deal. But then the road was barred by Geoffrey Cox. The attorney general judged that the UK might still find itself in the notorious backstop \u2013 an EU customs union \u2013 with no unilateral means of dissolving the arrangement. Indefinite backstop is a deal-breaker for hardliners. Cox\u2019s judgment spread disappointment well beyond the circle of noisy Brexit ultras. There is a quieter tranche of MPs whose first preference is that Brexitjust be done with a minimum of trauma. Most aren\u2019t that bothered about the detail. But May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, the only existing mechanism to achieve their goal, is just too toxic after so much high-profile scorn. Yesterday, writing in the Guardian, former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd warned that expecting the Commonwealth to fill the trade gap left by the EU, was \u201cutter delusion\u201d. Today, one of Australia\u2019s top business leaders has cautioned that the trade uncertainty caused by Brexit is hurting its trade partners. James Pearson, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the 300,000 businesses it represents were \u201cexposed quite heavily\u201d to export and import markets and the UK was a \u201csignificant\u201d trading partner. He said: [MPs] need to resolve the issues as soon as practical so that we can get on with building and strengthening further the United Kingdom-Australia trade and investment relationship. It\u2019s got a long history, it\u2019s a very strong and profitable one and a beneficial one for the people and businesses of both countries, so we are looking forward to doing that once this uncertainty is resolved. Political correspondent Peter Walker, has this excellent guide to what happens next. What happens next? As promised in advance by Theresa May, the next step will be motions on successive days to see first if MPs want to rule out a no-deal departure and then, if they do, whether they wish to extend article 50 and delay the Brexit process. The Conservatives will have a free vote on no deal. May stressed that Wednesday\u2019s vote would not rule out no deal for ever \u2013 just for now. And if MPs decline to rule out no deal, she said, it will become official government policy. What does this mean for Theresa May? Whatever happens, it\u2019s not good news. Badly losing two Commons votes on your government\u2019s flagship policy is unprecedented for a modern prime minister, and in any other political era would herald their imminent eviction from Downing Street. There had been speculation that May could even resign if she lost again. While she has not, she is badly weakened, and the challenges will surely come. For now, MPs\u2019 focus is on seeking to shape Brexit, and few would probably want to immediately take on her onerous task. But \u2013 as with everything in this matter \u2013 events could move very quickly. How long could Brexit be delayed? That depends, not least on whether MPs support this. May is adamant that if there is a pause it should be brief and not one that would require the UK to take part in the upcoming European elections, taking place in 10 weeks\u2019 time. But any Commons motion on extending article 50 will be amendable, and parliament might take another view. Could May seek a softer Brexit? Seemingly not, at least not yet. After the vote her spokesman reiterated the prime minister\u2019s opposition to any Brexit deal that involves a customs union. Meanwhile the EU has indicated that it has no appetite for further talks. What will Labour do next? While pushing for a second referendum is still among the party\u2019s official demands, in responding to May\u2019s defeat, Jeremy Corbyn spoke mainly about again pushing Labour\u2019s Brexit plan \u2013 which involves membership of a customs union, or the idea of a general election. But again, things could change quickly, and those MPs who back a second referendum have not given up on the idea. Could there be a general election? That is what some Conservative backbenchers loyal to May were warning would inevitably happen if she lost the latest vote. This is likely to have been intended as an extra warning to would-be Tory rebels, one that went largely unobserved. An election could still happen, but that would involve extending article 50 for longer than the government wants. The pound rose slightly overnight as traders took the Commons vote as a sign that Brexit is now more likely to be delayed. It is sitting at $1.309 and \u20ac1.16. David de Garis, a director of economics and market at National Australia Bank, told Reuters that he expected today\u2019s no-deal vote to go against the government as well as Thursday\u2019s expected vote to extend the article 50 trigger. That would be \u201cof some comfort to sterling\u201d, he said. But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s still a fast moving environment, with political pressure at understandably extreme levels.\u201d This graph shows the biggest government defeats in House of Commons. Tuesday night\u2019s comes in fourth; the largest remains Theresa May\u2019s first defeat on her Brexit plan in January. Theresa May looks downcast on the front pages of most of the papers today, which all focus on the defeat of the Brexit deal in the House of Commons last night. Our full wrap of how the papers covered the news is here. The interactive that allowed you to see how every MP voted on yesterday\u2019s motion seems to have had a bit of a malfunction when embedded in the blog. I\u2019ve take it down, but if you\u2019d like to search for your (or any) MP, you can do that here. And we will be updating the interactive with the results from all the Brexit votes this week. So, one to bookmark. Hello early-rising politics-watchers, welcome to our rolling coverage of today\u2019s politics news. After yesterday\u2019s thumping defeat of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal \u2013 which was defeated by 149 votes in the Commons \u2013 MPs are preparing to vote on another significant Brexit motion today. This time they will vote on whether or not a no-deal Brexit is possible. Donald Tusk warned that the outcome of last night\u2019s vote made a no-deal Brexit more likely, saying: \u201cOn the EU side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement ... With only 17 days left to 29 March, today\u2019s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d If MPs reject the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, they will vote on the possibility of delaying the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union on Thursday. Labour has said it will try to force the government to adopt its Brexit stance. After May was defeated, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election. It\u2019s going to be another big Brexit day, in another big Brexit week. We\u2019re glad to have you along for the ride.
